                    "document": "The definition of health literacy was updated in August 2020 with the release of the U.S. government’s Healthy People 2030external icon initiative. The update addresses personal health literacy and organizational health literacy and provides the following definitions:Personal health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.Organizational health literacy is the degree to which organizations equitably enable individuals to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.These definitions are a change from the health literacy definition used in Healthy People 2010 and Healthy People 2020: “the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.”The new definitions:Emphasize people’s ability to use health information rather than just understand itFocus on the ability to make “well-informed” decisions rather than “appropriate” onesAcknowledge that organizations have a responsibility to address health literacyIncorporate a public health perspectiveFrom a public health perspective, the organizational definition acknowledges that health literacy is connected to health equity. Health equity is the attainment of the highest level of health for all people. We will achieve health equity when everyone has the opportunity to be as healthy as possible.Rationale and Process for New Health Literacy DefinitionsIn the March 2021 article, “Updating Health Literacy for Healthy People 2030: Defining Its Importance for a New Decade in Public Health,” Santana and colleagues provide the rationale and process for updating the definition of health literacy.

                    "document": "While the term health equity is used widely, a common understanding of what it means is lacking.What is health equity?In a report designed to increase consensus around meaning of health equity, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation  provides the following definition: “Health equity means that everyone has a fair and just opportunity to be as healthy as possible. This requires removing obstacles to health such as poverty, discrimination, and their consequences, including powerlessness and lack of access to good jobs with fair pay, quality education and housing, safe environments, and health care.”The definitional concepts presented in the report are based on widely recognized ethical and human rights principles and supported by knowledge from health sciences.Consensus around definitions for an issue such as health equity can help bridge divides and foster productive dialogue among diverse stakeholder groups. Conversely, a lack of clarity can lead to detours, and pose a barrier to effective engagement and action.Also included in the report are examples of specific terms related to health equity that often arise in discussions around the concept."

                    "document": "Definitions of Food SecurityThis page provides the following information:Return to OverviewRanges of Food Security and Food InsecurityIn 2006, USDA introduced new language to describe ranges of severity of food insecurity. USDA made these changes in response to recommendations of an expert panel convened at USDA's request by the Committee on National Statistics  of the National Academies. Although new labels were introduced, the methods used to assess households' food security remained unchanged, so statistics for 2005 to now are directly comparable with those for earlier years. The following labels define ranges of food security:Food SecurityHigh food security : no reported indications of food-access problems or limitations.Marginal food security : one or two reported indications—typically of anxiety over food sufficiency or shortage of food in the house. Little or no indication of changes in diets or food intake.Food InsecurityLow food security : reports of reduced quality, variety, or desirability of diet. Little or no indication of reduced food intake.Very low food security : reports of multiple indications of disrupted eating patterns and reduced food intake.CNSTAT Review and RecommendationsUSDA requested the review by CNSTAT to ensure that the measurement methods USDA uses to assess households' access—or lack of access—to adequate food and the language used to describe those conditions are conceptually and operationally sound and that they convey relevant information to policy officials and the public. The CNSTAT panel that conducted this study included economists, sociologists, nutritionists, statisticians, and other researchers. One of the central issues the panel addressed was whether the concepts and definitions underlying the measurement methods—especially the concept and definition of hunger and the relationship between hunger and food insecurity—were appropriate for the policy context in which food security statistics are used.The CNSTAT panel:Recommended that USDA continue to measure and monitor food insecurity regularly in a household survey.Affirmed that the general methodology used to measure food insecurity is appropriate.Suggested several ways to refine the methodology . ERS published technical research reports on potential refinements and continues to conduct research on these issues. See:                                The CNSTAT panel also recommended that USDA make a clear and explicit distinction between food insecurity and hunger:Food insecurity—the condition assessed in the food security survey and represented in USDA food security reports—is a household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food.Hunger is an individual-level physiological condition that may result from food insecurity.The word \"hunger,\" the panel stated in its final report, \"...should refer to a potential consequence of food insecurity that, because of prolonged, involuntary lack of food, results in discomfort, illness, weakness, or pain that goes beyond the usual uneasy sensation.\" To measure hunger in this sense would require collecting more detailed and extensive information on physiological experiences of individual household members than could be accomplished effectively in the Current Population Survey . The panel recommended, therefore, that new methods be developed to measure hunger and that a national assessment of hunger be conducted using an appropriate survey of individuals rather than a survey of households.The CNSTAT panel also recommended that USDA consider alternative labels to convey the severity of food insecurity without using the word \"hunger,\" since hunger is not adequately assessed in the food security survey. USDA concurred and introduced the labels \"low food security\" and \"very low food security\" in 2006.For more information on CNSTAT Recommendations...Characteristics of Households with Very Low Food SecurityConditions reported by households with very low food security are compared with those reported by food-secure households and by households with low  food security in the following chart:                                                Download chart data in Excel formatThe defining characteristic of very low food security is that—at times during the year—food intake of household members is reduced and their normal eating patterns are disrupted because the household lacks money and other resources for food. Very low food security is characterized in terms of the conditions that households in this category typically reported in the annual survey.98 percent reported having worried their food would run out before they had money to buy more.97 percent reported the food they bought just did not last, and they did not have money to get more.94 percent reported they could not afford to eat balanced meals.95 percent reported an adult had cut the size of meals or skipped meals because there was not enough money for food; 87 percent reported this had occurred in 3 or more months.94 percent reported they had eaten less than they felt they should because there was not enough money for food.67 percent reported they had been hungry but did not eat because they could not afford enough food.47 percent reported having lost weight because they did not have enough money for food.32 percent reported an adult did not eat for a whole day because there was not enough money for food; 24 percent reported this had occurred in 3 or more months.All households without children that were classified as having very low food security reported at least 6 of these conditions, and 69 percent reported 7 or more. Food-insecure conditions in households with children followed a similar pattern.Return to Overview"

                    "document": "Substances consumed for nutritionFood is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their unique metabolisms, often evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Historically, humans secured food through two main methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture. As agricultural technologies increased, humans settled into agriculture lifestyles with diets shaped by the agriculture opportunities in their geography. Geographic and cultural differences has led to creation of numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes. As cultures have mixed through forces like international trade and globalization, ingredients have become more widely available beyond their geographic and cultural origins, creating a cosmopolitan exchange of different food traditions and practices.Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever-increasing population of the world is supplied by the industrial food industry, which produces food with intensive agriculture and distributes it through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural system is one of the major contributors to climate change, accountable for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing the carbon intensity of the food system and food waste are important mitigation measures in the global response to climate change.[citation needed]The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues including: sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food. The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights , recognizing the \"right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food\", as well as the \"fundamental right to be free from hunger\". Because of these fundamental rights, food security is often a priority international policy activity; for example Sustainable Development Goal 2 \"Zero hunger\" is meant to eliminate hunger by 2030. Food safety and food security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council, and are often subject to national regulation by institutions, like the Food and Drug Administration in the United States.Definition and classificationFood is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support and energy to an organism. It can be raw, processed or formulated and is consumed orally by animals for growth, health or pleasure. Food is mainly composed of water, lipids, proteins and carbohydrates. Minerals  and organic substances  can also be found in food. Some inorganic  elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning. Other aspects of the web include detrovores  and decomposers . Corn , wheat, and rice account for 87% of all grain production worldwide. Just over half of the worlds crops are used to feed humans , with 36 percent grown as animal feed and 9 percent for biofuels. Fungi and bacteria are also used in the preparation of fermented foods like bread, wine, cheese and yogurt. Food is a fruit if the part eaten is derived from the reproductive tissue, so seeds, nuts and grains are technically fruit. Grains can be defined as seeds that humans eat or harvest, with cereal grains  belonging to the Poaceae  family and pulses coming from the Fabaceae  family. Whole grains are foods that contain all the elements of the original seed .Fleshy fruits  can be further classified as stone fruits , pome fruits , berries  ,  citrus , melons , Mediterranean fruits , tropical fruits . These include root vegetables , bulbs , flowers , leaf vegetables  and stem vegetables .  Most vitamins are found from plant sources, with the notable exceptions of vitamin D and vitamin B12. Minerals are also plentiful, although the presence of phytates can prevent their release. Compared to fleshy fruit  vegetables are high in starch, leaves, while shoot eaters are folivores  and wood eaters termed xylophages . There are many types of grasses, adapted to different locations, that animals  use as their main source of nutrients. Oilseeds are often pressed to produce rich oils - sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed  and sesame. One 4-ounce  steak, chicken breast or pork chop contains about 30 grams of protein. One large egg has 7 grams of protein, a 4-ounce  serving of cheese about 15 grams and 1 cup of milk about 8. Other nutrients found in animal products include calories, fat, essential vitamins  and minerals .Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products . In addition, birds and other animals lay eggs, which are often eaten, and bees produce honey, a reduced nectar from flowers, which is a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures consume blood, sometimes in the form of blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, or in a cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare.Some cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons. Vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Vegans do not consume any foods that are or contain ingredients from an animal source.Taste perceptionAnimals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. As animals have evolved, the tastes that provide the most energy  are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as bitter, are not enjoyable.SourSourness is caused by the taste of acids, such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include citrus, specifically lemons, limes, and to a lesser degree oranges. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria. Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.SaltySaltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt, fleur de sel, kosher salt, mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function. Salt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. Some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.BitterBitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste. Unsweetened dark chocolate, caffeine, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.UmamiUmami \" class=\"IPA\" lang=\"ja-Latn-fonipa\">), or savoriness, is one of the five basic tastes.: 35–36 People taste umami through taste receptors that typically respond to glutamates and  nucleotides, which are widely present in meat broths and fermented products. Glutamates are commonly added to some foods in the form of monosodium glutamate , and nucleotides are commonly added in the form of inosine monophosphate  or guanosine monophosphate .Foods that have a strong umami flavor include meats, shellfish, fish , tomatoes, mushrooms, hydrolyzed vegetable protein, meat extract, yeast extract, cheeses, and soy sauce.CuisineMany scholars claim that the rhetorical function of food is to represent the culture of a country, and that it can be used as a form of communication. According to Goode, Curtis and Theophano, food \"is the last aspect of an ethnic culture to be lost\".Many cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of cooking traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. Other differences include preferences  and practices, the study of which is known as gastronomy. Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.Some popular types of ethnic foods include Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, American, Cajun, Thai, African, Indian and Nepalese. Various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food habits. While evolutionarily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are omnivores, religion and social constructs such as morality, activism, or environmentalism will often affect which foods they will consume. Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of taste, the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.PresentationAesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. A common saying is that people \"eat with their eyes\". Food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor, even if unsatisfactory.Texture plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods. Contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. Common examples include adding granola to yogurt, adding croutons to a salad or soup, and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter.Another universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. For example, such opposite flavors as sweetness and saltiness tend to go well together, as in kettle corn and nuts.Food preparationWhile many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety, palatability, texture, or flavor. At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. It may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, pressure cooking, fermentation, or combination with other food. In a home, most food preparation takes place in a kitchen. Some preparation is done to enhance the taste or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to preserve the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. A meal is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place.  A refrigerator helps to keep foods fresh.Animal preparationThe preparation of animal-based food usually involves slaughter, evisceration, hanging, portioning, and rendering. In developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in slaughterhouses, which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. Many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. For example, the United States has established the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance with religious law, such as kosher, shechita, and dhabīḥah halal. Strict interpretations of kashrut require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut. The health food movement known as raw foodism promotes a mostly vegan diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and grains prepared in various ways, including juicing, food dehydration, sprouting, and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above 118 °F .Cooking equipment  A traditional asado There are many different types of equipment used for cooking.Ovens are mostly hollow devices that get very hot ) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a tandoor oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature.Various types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a sauté pan, sauce pot, frying pan, or pressure cooker. These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as steaming, simmering, boiling, and poaching for moist methods, while the dry methods include sautéing, pan frying, and deep-frying.In addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A grill operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open-pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking. A Mexican style of barbecue is called barbacoa, which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. In Argentina, an asado  is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled.Restaurants  The Allyn House restaurant menu Restaurants employ chefs to prepare the food, and waiters to serve customers at the table. The term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative meat broth; this broth  was served in elegant outlets in Paris from the mid 18th century.In 2005, the population of the United States spent $496 billion on out-of-home dining. Expenditures by type of out-of-home dining were as follows: 40% in full-service restaurants, 37.2% in limited service restaurants , 6.6% in schools or colleges, 5.4% in bars and vending machines, 4.7% in hotels and motels, 4.0% in recreational places, and 2.2% in others, which includes military bases.[better source needed][relevant?]Economy  SeaWiFS image for the global biosphere  Global average daily calorie consumption in 1995 Food systems have complex economic and social value chains that effect many parts of the global economy.ProductionMost food has always been obtained through agriculture. With increasing concern over both the methods and products of modern industrial agriculture, there has been a growing trend toward sustainable agricultural practices. This approach, partly fueled by consumer demand, encourages biodiversity, local self-reliance and organic farming methods. Major influences on food production include international organizations , national government policy , and war.Several organisations have begun calling for a new kind of agriculture in which agroecosystems provide food but also support vital ecosystem services so that soil fertility and biodiversity are maintained rather than compromised. According to the International Water Management Institute and UNEP, well-managed agroecosystems not only provide food, fiber and animal products, they also provide services such as flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, erosion control and habitats for plants, birds, fish and other animals.Food manufacturing  Packaged household food itemsPackaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase. This can be as simple as a butcher preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international food industry. Early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation, packaging, and transportation. This mainly involved salting, curing, curdling, drying, pickling, fermenting, and smoking. This development took advantage of new mass markets and emerging technology, such as milling, preservation, packaging and labeling, and transportation. It brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants. Food prices have an impact on producers and consumers of food.  The Food and Agriculture Organization  Food Price Index 1961–2021 in nominal and real terms. The Real Price Index is the Nominal Price Index deflated by the World Bank Manufactures Unit Value Index . Years 2014–2016 is 100.Price levels depend on the food production process, including food marketing and food distribution. Fluctuation in food prices is determined by a number of compounding factors. \"The CPI  for all food increased 0.8% from July 2022 to August 2022, and food prices were 11.4% higher than in August 2021.\"As investmentFood speculation refers to the buying and selling of futures contracts by traders with the aim of profiting from changes in food prices. Food speculation can be both positive and negative for food producers and buyers. is betting on food prices  financial markets. Food speculation by global players like banks, hedge funds or pension funds is alleged to cause price swings in staple foods such as wheat, maize and soy – even though too large price swings in an idealized economy are theoretically ruled out: Adam Smith in 1776 reasoned that the only way to make money from commodities trading is by buying low and selling high, which has the effect of smoothing out price swings and mitigating shortages. For the actors, the apparently random swings are predictable, which means potential huge profits. For the global poor, food speculation and resulting price peaks may result in increased poverty or even famine.In contrast to food hoarding, speculation does not mean that real food shortages or scarcity need to be evoked, the price changes are only due to trading activity.ProblemsBecause of its centrality to human life, problems related to access, quality and production of food effect every aspect of human life.Nutrition and dietary problemsBetween the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy, obesity, or osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.Nutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the minerals and vitamins. Additionally, food contains water and dietary fiber.As previously discussed, the body is designed by natural selection to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for hunters and gatherers. Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with advanced technology, enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes obesity in adults and children alike.Hunger and starvationFood deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately starvation. This is often connected with famine, which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. Rationing is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war.Food waste  Fruit and vegetables in a dumpster, discarded uneaten  Food recovered by food waste critic Rob Greenfield in Madison, Wisconsin, from two days of recovery from dumpsters The analysis estimated that global food waste was 931 million tonnes of food waste  across three sectors: 61 per cent from households, 26 per cent from food service and 13 per cent from retail.) and other environmental issues, such as land use, water use and loss of biodiversity. Prevention of food waste is the highest priority, and when prevention is not possible, the food waste hierarchy ranks the food waste treatment options from preferred to least preferred based on their negative environmental impacts.Legal definitionSome countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word foodstuff. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as food includes any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by humans. In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, chewing gum, water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include animal feed, live animals , plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, cosmetics, tobacco and tobacco products, narcotic or psychotropic substances, and residues and contaminants.Right to food  Right to food around the world .   Adopted or drafting a framework law .   Constitutional, explicit as a right .   Constitutional, implicit in broader rights or as directive principle .   Direct applicability via international treaties .    No known right to food. Note: The same country can fall in multiple categories; the colour given to a country corresponds to the highest listed category in which a country falls.The right to food, and its variations, is a human right protecting the right of people to feed themselves in dignity, implying that sufficient food is available, that people have the means to access it, and that it adequately meets the individual's dietary needs. The right to food protects the right of all human beings to be free from hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition.Food securityFood security speaks to the availability of food in a country  and the ability of individuals within that country  to access, afford, and source adequate foodstuffs. According to the United Nations' Committee on World Food Security, food security is defined as meaning that all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets their food preferences and dietary needs for an active and healthy life. Food insecurity, on the other hand, is defined by the United States Department of Agriculture  as a situation of \"limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways\". The United Nations  recognized the Right to Food in the Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles  during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze. In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points , which can identify and eliminate many risks.Foods that spoil easily, such as meats, dairy, and seafood, must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. As such, the rule of thumb is that cold foods  should be kept cold and hot foods  should be kept hot until storage. Cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as Salmonella or E. coli. The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are gluten, corn, shellfish , peanuts, and soy. Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as diarrhea, rashes, bloating, vomiting, and regurgitation. The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen.Rarely, food allergies can lead to a medical emergency, such as anaphylactic shock, hypotension , and loss of consciousness. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although latex products can induce similar reactions. Initial treatment is with epinephrine , often carried by known patients in the form of an Epi-pen or Twinject.There are many international certifications in the cooking field, such as Monde Selection, A.A. Certification, iTQi. They use high-quality evaluation methods to make the food safer.Diet  Changes of food supply Other area  Further concerns about the impact of industrial farming  on animal welfare, human health, and the environment are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits. This has led to the emergence of a movement with a preference for organic and local food.See alsoReferences^ SAPEA . A sustainable food system for the European Union .

With the abundance of information available, how do you know what's actually good for you? Here are the top 15 foods you should be eating according to our experts:1. Fish“Eat plenty of fish, which are high in healthy omega 3 fatty acids, and smaller portions of red meat to reduce your risk of diseases like stroke, heart disease and cancer.\" – Bob Canter, professor of surgery at UC Davis Division of Surgical Oncology2. Broccoli or any of the cruciferous vegetables“These foods are rich in nutrients including glucosinolates, which are key in detoxification processes. These are best served raw or quick-steamed for five to ten minutes.” – Alex Nella, pediatric registered dietitian3. Beets“No matter which color – red, yellow, golden – or which part – root or greens – they contain a wonderful variety of protective carotenoids. Evidence suggests their dietary nitrates can be converted to nitric oxide and improve endurance exercise.\" – Alex Nella, pediatric registered dietitian4. Spinach and other leafy green vegetables“These are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin: nutrients that can help protect against macular degeneration.” – Jeffrey Caspar, professor of ophthalmology at the UC Davis Eye Center5.

                    "document": "This article lists the 15 foods that sources and studies across the United States and Western Europe deem the most healthful.It is vital to have awareness of the most healthful foods to ensure a wide a range of nutrients in the diet.A balanced diet is the secret to healthful eating. This article will cover the 15 most healthful foods and their benefits.Share on PinterestA healthful diet can help ensure that the body gets all the nutrients it needs.Nuts, pulses, and grains are all highly nutritious. The following are some of the most healthful:1. AlmondsAlmonds provide plenty of nutrients, including:One 2019 meta-analysis found that consuming almonds significantly reduced total cholesterol levels.2. Brazil nutsBrazil nuts  are some of the most healthful nuts available.They are an excellent source of both protein and carbohydrates, and they also provide good amounts of vitamin B-1, vitamin E, magnesium, and zinc.Brazil nuts also contain more selenium than many other foods. Selenium is a vital mineral for maintaining thyroid function, and it is a great antioxidant for the human body.These nuts come in a hard shell and are usually available ready to eat, making them a quick, nutritious snack.Learn more about Brazil nuts here.3. LentilsA lentil is a pulse that features prominently in many food cultures around the world, including those of Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka.Lentils provide good amounts of fiber, magnesium, and potassium.They tend to require a long cooking time. However, manufacturers can sprout the seeds, making them a delicious, healthful, ready-to-eat snack.Adding a container of sprouted lentils to a lunchbox or picnic basket, perhaps with some chili powder or pepper for flavoring, makes for a delicious and healthful snack.Learn more about the health benefits of lentils here.4. OatmealInterest in oatmeal has increased considerably during the past 20 years because of its health benefits.In 1997, the Food and Drug Administration  agreed that foods with high levels of rolled oats or oat bran could include data on the label about their cardiovascular health benefits as part of a low fat diet. This led to a surge in oatmeal’s popularity.Research has found that the cereal’s soluble fiber content helps lower cholesterol levels and reduce cardiovascular risk factors.Oats contain complex carbohydrates, as well as water-soluble fiber. These slow down digestion and help stabilize levels of blood glucose. Oatmeal is also a good source of folate and potassium.People can make oatmeal from rolled or ground oats. Coarse or steel-cut oats contain more fiber than instant varieties.5. Wheat germWheat germ is the part of wheat that grows into a plant. It is essentially the embryo of a seed. Germ, along with bran, is a byproduct of milling. Refining cereals often removes the germ and bran content.Whole grain products, however, still contain the germ and bran. This makes them a more healthful choice.Wheat germ is high in several vital nutrients, including:fibervitamin Efolic acidthiaminzincmagnesiumphosphorusfatty alcoholsessential fatty acidsFruits, vegetables, and berries are easy to incorporate into the diet. The following are some of the most healthful:6. BroccoliBroccoli provides good amounts of fiber, calcium, potassium, folate, and phytonutrients. Phytonutrients are compounds that reduce the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and some cancers.Broccoli also provides essential antioxidants such as vitamin C and beta-carotene. In fact, a single half-cup serving of broccoli can provide around 85% of a person’s daily vitamin C value.Another compound in broccoli, called sulforaphane, may have anticancer and anti-inflammatory qualities, according to one 2019 study.However, overcooking broccoli can destroy many of its key nutrients. For this reason, it is best to eat it raw or lightly steamed.Learn more about the nutritional impact of broccoli here.7. ApplesApples are an excellent source of antioxidants, which combat free radicals. Free radicals are damaging substances that the body generates. They cause undesirable changes in the body and may contribute to chronic conditions, as well as the aging process.However, some studies have suggested that an antioxidant in apples might extend a person’s life span and reduce the risk of chronic disease.Learn more about apples here.8. KaleKale is a leafy green vegetable that offers a wide range of different nutrients. For example, this powerfully nutritious plant is an excellent source of vitamins C and K.People can cook or steam kale. They can also blend it into smoothies or juices for a nutritional kick.Learn more about how to include kale in the diet here.9. BlueberriesBlueberries provide substantial amounts of fiber, antioxidants, and phytonutrients. Unlike minerals and vitamins, phytonutrients are not essential for survival. However, they may help prevent disease and maintain vital bodily functions.In a 2019 review of 16 studies, the authors suggest that consuming blueberries may help protect against cognitive decline, which may help reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. They also found that blueberries might help prevent cardiovascular disease.Another 2019 study, this time in mice, found that blueberry polyphenols reduced obesity and certain metabolic risk factors. They also improved the composition of gut bacteria.According to a 2015 clinical trial, eating 22 grams of freeze dried blueberries every day for 8 weeks led to a significant decrease in blood pressure among women with stage 1 hypertension.Discover the nutritional power of blueberries.10. AvocadosSome people avoid consuming avocados due to their high fat content. However, avocados provide healthful fats, as well as B vitamins, vitamin K, and vitamin E. Avocados are also a good source of fiber.In one 2018 review of studies, avocados increased levels of high-density lipoprotein, or “good,” cholesterol. This type of cholesterol removes more harmful cholesterol from the bloodstream.Avocados might also have anticancer properties. A 2019 test tube study of avocados showed that colored avocado seed extract reduced the viability of breast, colon, and prostate cancer cells. However, the study did not indicate whether or not the effects would be the same in humans.Avocados may also have associations with improved nutrient absorption, better overall diet, and fewer metabolic risk factors, according to one 2013 study.Avocados are highly nutritious and very filling. Learn more about them here.11. Leafy green vegetablesOne 2019 study in rats showed that consuming leafy greens for 6 weeks led to a significant reduction in cardiovascular risk factors.Spinach is an example of a leafy green with antioxidant content, especially when it is raw, steamed, or very lightly boiled. It is a good source of the following nutrients:vitamins A, B-6, C, E, and KseleniumniacinzincphosphoruscopperpotassiumcalciummanganesebetaineironLearn about the many benefits of spinach here.12. Sweet potatoesSweet potatoes provide dietary fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B-6, and potassium.The Center for Science in the Public Interest compared the nutritional value of sweet potatoes with that of several other vegetables.Sweet potatoes ranked number one for their vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, protein, and complex carbohydrate content.When it comes to fish, meat, and eggs, many healthful options are available. For example:13. Oily fishSome examples of oily fish include salmon, trout, mackerel, herring, sardines, and anchovies. These types of fish have oil in their tissues and around their gut.Their lean fillets contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids. These oils may provide benefits for the heart and nervous system, according to the Office of Dietary Supplements .The ODS also suggest that omega-3 fatty acids can help with inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. They are also plentiful in vitamins A and D.One 2014 study suggested that fatty acids can significantly reduce the risk of rheumatoid arthritis.14. ChickenChicken is a cost effective and healthful meat. Free-range chicken serves as an excellent source of protein.However, it is important to remember that preparation and cooking methods affect how healthful chicken is. This means that people should limit their intake of deep-fried chicken and always remove the skin before consumption. Chicken skin has high levels of saturated fat.15. EggsEggs are another source of protein that people can easily incorporate into a balanced diet, as they are highly versatile.Eggs contain vitamins including B-2 and B-12, both of which are important for preserving energy and generating red blood cells. Eggs are also a good source of the essential amino acid leucine, which plays a role in stimulating muscle protein synthesis. Eggs also provide a good amount of choline, which is important for cell membranes.The yolk contains most of the egg’s vitamins and minerals, as well as the fat and cholesterol. However, one 2017 review found that eating up to seven eggs per week does not increase the risk of heart disease. That said, the authors mention that people with cardiovascular disease or diabetes should seek medical consultation about including eggs in the diet.Indeed, one study found higher rates of cardiovascular disease in people who consumed more cholesterol from eggs.Consuming fat in moderate amounts is healthful as part of a balanced, nutritious diet.Learn more about eggs here.Including these 15 foods in the diet can provide notable health benefits. However, it is important for people to have a balanced diet that does not focus on one specific type of food.People should remember that having an occasional treat is not going to be harmful to overall health, as long as they ensure a regular and varied intake of nutrients."

                    "document": "Australian Dietary Guidelines Do you know what foods are best to put on your plate? Or how much you should eat and how often?   The Australian Dietary Guidelines provide up-to-date advice about the types and recommended number of serves of the different foods that we need to eat for good nutrition and health. These are shown in the Australian Guide to Healthy  Eating .  The Guidelines are developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, working with independent experts in nutrition. They are based on the best available science about the types and amounts of foods and the dietary patterns that are thought to promote health and wellbeing, and reduce your risk of diet-related conditions and chronic disease.   Eat a variety of foods Healthy eating means eating a wide variety of foods from each of the 5 major food groups, in the amounts recommended. Eating a variety of foods from the 5 major food groups provides a range of nutrients to the body, promotes good health and can help reduce the risk of disease - as well as keeping your diet interesting with different flavours and textures. Many of the foods that often feature regularly in modern diets do not form part of the 5 food groups. These foods, sometimes referred to as 'junk' foods, 'discretionary choices' or 'occasional foods' can be enjoyed sometimes, but should not feature regularly in a healthy diet. Fats and  oils  are high in kilojoules  but necessary for a healthy diet in small amounts. No matter where you're starting, it's easy to make little changes to bring your eating closer in line with the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Just focus on eating foods from the 5 major food groups and reducing your intake of occasional foods. 5 major food groups The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating groups the foods that should make up our daily diets into 5 major food groups. The 5 food groups are:  Foods are grouped together because they provide similar amounts of key nutrients. For example, key nutrients of the milk, yoghurt, cheese and alternatives group include calcium and protein, while the fruit group is a good source of vitamins, especially vitamin C. Eating a varied, well-balanced diet means eating a variety of foods from each of the 5 food groups daily, in the recommended amounts. Because different foods provide different types and amounts of key nutrients, it is important to choose a variety of foods from within each food group. As a bonus, choosing a variety of foods will help to make your meals interesting, so that you don't get bored with your diet. Occasional foods Some foods do not fit into the 5 food groups because they are not necessary for a healthy diet. These foods are called 'discretionary choices'  and they should only be eaten occasionally. They tend to be too high in saturated fat, added sugars, added salt or alcohol, and have low levels of important nutrients like fibre. These foods and drinks can also be too high in kilojoules . Regularly eating more kilojoules than your body needs will lead to weight gain. Examples of 'discretionary choices' or occasional foods are: sweet biscuits, cakes, desserts and pastries processed meats and fatty, salty sausages, savoury pastries and pies, with a high fat or salt content takeaway foods such as hot chips, hamburgers and pizza sweetened condensed milk alcoholic drinks ice cream and other ice confections confectionary and chocolate commercially fried foods potato chips, crisps and other fatty and/or salty snack foods including some savoury biscuits cream, butter and spreads which are high in saturated fats sugar-sweetened soft drinks and cordials, sports and energy drinks. It's okay to have some of these foods now and then as an extra treat. But if these foods regularly replace more nutritious and healthier foods in your diet, your risk of developing obesity and chronic disease, such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer, increases. Restaurant meals and takeaway foods  Restaurant meals and takeaway foods are often high in saturated fat, added salt, added sugars, and kilojoules.   Think about how often you consume food and drinks prepared outside the home. If you’re doing this regularly, consider cutting back and focusing more on the 5 major food groups. That doesn’t mean you have to stop completely.  Suggestions for reducing saturated fat in takeaway food options include:  Try ordering a takeaway meal without the fries.  Choose bread-based options like wraps, kebabs, souvlaki or hamburgers.  Avoid deep fried and pastry options.  Include extra vegetables and salad.  Choose smaller portions or share with someone else and add a green salad to reduce the kilojoules of the meal.  Limit high fat, high salt sauces and toppings like cheese, fatty meats and mayonnaise – remember, you can ask for less.  Choose tomato-based pasta sauces, rather than cream-based sauces.  Drink plenty of water.   Don’t upsize unless it’s with a side salad.  Fast foods that have relatively low levels of saturated fat and added salt include:  pizzas with less cheese and meat  grilled chicken burgers or wraps  grilled, lean meat hamburgers, with no cheese or bacon additions  grilled fish burgers. High sugar foods Foods and drinks like soft drinks, cordials, biscuits, cakes and confectionary are high in added sugars and high in kilojoules. Sugar itself does not lead to diabetes. But added sugars can cause weight gain and being overweight increases a person’s risk of type 2 diabetes. Sugar-sweetened drinks are the largest source of sugars in the diets of Australians. There is strong evidence of an association between increasing consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks and the development of childhood obesity and tooth decay. That’s why eating foods and drinks with a high sugar content should be limited. Sugar-free versions are okay to drink sometimes, but sugar-free fizzy drinks are still acidic, which can have a negative effect on bone and dental health. Water is the healthiest drink – try adding a slice of lemon, lime or orange for flavour. Drink alcohol in moderation Alcoholic drinks are ‘occasional foods’ according to the Australian Guide to Healthy Eating. Alcohol is high in energy . If you choose to drink alcohol, only drink it in moderation. To reduce the risk of harm from alcohol-related disease or injury, healthy men and women should drink no more than 10 standard drinks a week and no more than 4 standard drinks on any one day. The less you drink, the lower your risk of harm from alcohol. One standard drink is 375 ml mid-strength beer, 100 ml wine or 30 ml spirits. If you drink more than this, consider reducing the amount. You might go about this by increasing the number of days in the week where you don’t drink alcohol, or alternating your alcoholic drinks with water. Children and pregnant or breastfeeding women should not drink alcohol. High-salt foods Too much salt in the diet has been associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure, which is a known risk factor for heart disease and stroke. Eating less than 5 g of salt per day  is recommended for adults with normal blood pressure. Many Australians consume double this amount each day. The majority of our salt intake comes from packaged and processed foods we eat every day, like bread, processed meats and soups. Cutting back on takeaway foods will help reduce your salt intake. Healthy fats The Australian Dietary Guidelines include a small allowance for healthy fats each day . Consuming unsaturated  fats in small amounts is an important part of a healthy diet. It helps with: the absorption of vitamins  reducing your risk of heart disease lowering your cholesterol levels - if the healthy fats replace saturated  fats in your diet. There are 2 main types of unsaturated fats: monounsaturated fats - found in olive and canola oil, avocados, cashews and almonds polyunsaturated fats, such as:omega-3  fats  - found in oily fish omega-6 fats - found in safflower and soybean oil, and Brazil nuts. The best way to include healthy fats in your diet is to replace saturated fat that you may currently be eating  with a healthier, unsaturated fat option . Learn more about fats and oils. How much do I need from each food group each day? How much you need from each food group each day depends on your age, gender and activity levels. The Australian Guide to Healthy  Eating  outlines how many serves you and your family need each day, and standard serve sizes for foods and drinks.

Vegetables - daily serve One standard serve of vegetables is about 75 g  or: ½ cup cooked vegetables  ½ cup cooked dried or canned beans, peas or lentils  1 cup of green leafy or raw salad vegetables ½ cup sweet corn ½ medium potato or other starchy vegetables  1 medium tomato. Fruit - daily serve One standard serve of fruit is about 150 g  or: 1 medium piece  2 small pieces  1 cup diced or canned fruit .

If you do not eat any foods from this group, the following foods contain about the same amount of calcium as a serve of milk, yoghurt, cheese or alternatives: 100 g almonds with skin 60 g sardines, canned, in water ½ cup  canned pink salmon with bones 100 g firm tofu . Be mindful that some of these contain more kilojoules , especially the nuts. Change the way you think about food  There are lots of myths about healthy food. Don’t make food choices based on false beliefs. Some things to try include:  Don’t think that your diet must be ‘all or nothing’. Eating well doesn’t mean you must worry about eating healthily all the time. A good diet allows for treats occasionally.  Compare the prices of junk foods against the price of healthier food options to see that ‘healthy’ doesn’t have to mean ‘expensive’.  Experiment with different foods and recipes. A meal cooked with fresh ingredients is better than a limp burger or soggy chips.  Try different ‘fast’ options like whole-wheat breakfast cereal, muesli, wholemeal bread, wholegrain muffins, fruit, yoghurt or pasta.  When eating out, look for kilojoule labelling on menus and check before you choose. A single energy-dense meal may contain most of an adult’s daily kilojoule intake, and drinks can be high in kilojoules too.  Don’t give up your favourite meals entirely. Try thinking of new ways to create healthy meals – for example, you could make recipes lower in fat by changing the cooking method – grill, stir-fry, bake, boil or microwave, instead of deep frying.  Reduce the size of your meal or food instead of giving it up entirely. More doesn’t always mean better.  If you’re worried about missing out on socialising, instead of meeting friends for food, perhaps go for a walk instead. Or you could suggest a food outlet that serves healthier foods, such as wholemeal rolls with vegetable fillings, or sushi.  Get organised with food planning  Planning ahead can make changing your dietary habits a whole lot easier:  Make a shopping list before you shop and plan what meals you’re going to eat and when.  Keep a filled fruit bowl at home for fast, low-kilojoule snacks.  Vary your meals. You may get bored and lose motivation if you don’t try different ingredients and recipes.  Search the internet to find interesting and easy recipes and cooking tips – have a read of these tasty  recipes .  Cook in bulk to save time – for example, soups, stews, casseroles and bolognese sauce are all easy to cook a lot of, and then freeze in portions for later use.  Eat breakfast every day so you’re less likely to snack on occasional foods at morning tea. A wholemeal or wholegrain breakfast cereal that is low in sugar, served with low-fat milk, can provide plenty of vitamins, minerals and fibre. Other fast and healthy options include yoghurt or wholemeal toast.  Stock your food cupboard and fridge  Stock your food cupboard and fridge with ingredients that are quick to prepare and easy to cook. Meal suggestions include:  Soups – easy to make and nutritious, especially if you add lots of vegetables, beans or lentils. You can use canned tomatoes and ready-made  stock as a base and add your own herbs, spices and leftovers.  Pasta – quick and easy to prepare. Keep tins of tomatoes in your cupboard and add your own variations and flavours.  Rice – try making fried rice or risotto, or mix cooked rice with leftover vegetables and meat.  Beans and lentils – canned varieties can make a quick and nutritious addition to soups and stews. Lentils and beans can be used as a main meal with vegetables added.  Vegetables and fruit – make vegetable curries, stir-fries and vegetable patties and soups. Canned and frozen vegetables can easily be added to last minute meals. Fruit is good for a quick nutritious snack.  Meat and fish – tinned tuna is a great cupboard stand-by. Shop for cheap cuts of meat for slow cooking in stews and casseroles.  Condiments – add flavour and interest to your cooking. Keep a selection of dried herbs, spices, curry powder, vinegars, in your cupboard. Tomato sauce, soy sauce and stock cubes also provide great flavour, but they are high in salt – use them only in small amounts.  Healthy eating on a budget  Healthy doesn’t mean expensive. Here are some ways to save money on food:  Cook extra for the evening meal so you can use the leftovers for a quick meal the following night or for lunch.  Cook double the amount then freeze what is left over in meal-size portions.  Shop at the local markets close to closing time for discounted fruit, vegetable and meat bargains.  Buy in bulk  and freeze in smaller portion sizes to use as required.  Use cheaper cuts of meat for curries and casseroles for long slow cooking, then add extra vegetables and beans to make the meal go further.  One-pot dishes where you throw everything in together save energy, time, money and washing up.  Watch out for supermarket specials of staples  and stock up on them when they are cheap. Bread can be frozen for at least two months, and items such as pasta and rice have a long shelf life.  Limit takeaway foods – they can be expensive, high in fat, high in salt, low in nutrition, and leave you hungry again a few hours after you eat them.  Buy fresh produce in season – it’s often cheaper as it’s grown locally and fresher. Where to get help"
