{"What is the sense of smell of a dog?": ["They haven't got no noses, The fallen sons of Eve; Even the smell of roses Is not what they supposes; But more than mind discloses And more than men believe. \u2014from \"The Song of the Quoodle,\" G.K. Chesterton My dog Jones used to do the most curious thing whenever my friend Burk visited my house. Jones was a mutt from the pound, so before we adopted him he might have picked up some unsavory habits. But he'd sidle over to Burk, rub up against him, and start to lift his leg on him.Jones, a greyhound-black lab mix who, bless his big heart, passed on at age 15 a few years ago, never did that with any other visitor. Burk didn't smell or wear stinky clothes, and he didn't antagonize or otherwise provoke Jones. Burk did have a dog of his own, a redbone coonhound named Hattie, but other visitors had dogs. In short, he shouldn't have stood out in any way from anyone else. But to Jones, Burk was like a fresh wall to a graffiti artist.Why? For me, Jones's behavior\u2014which even a dog-cognition expert acknowledged was unusual\u2014epitomizes the mystery that is dogs' sense of smell. What lies behind this astonishing capability of theirs, one that makes the world not a visual one as it is to us but a richly odoriferous one? How do their noses differ from ours, and what do their brains do differently? Finally, is there an answer to why Jones tried to pee on Burk every time he set foot in my place?Olympic sniffersDogs' sense of smell overpowers our own by orders of magnitude\u2014it's 10,000 to 100,000 times as acute, scientists say. \"Let's suppose they're just 10,000 times better,\" says James Walker, former director of the Sensory Research Institute at Florida State University, who, with several colleagues, came up with that jaw-dropping estimate during a rigorously designed, oft-cited study. \"If you make the analogy to vision, what you and I can see at a third of a mile, a dog could see more than 3,000 miles away and still see as well.\"Figure 1: When a dog breathes in, the air separates into distinct paths, one  flowing into the olfactory area and the other  passing through the pharynx  to the lungs.                \u00a9 Courtesy of Brent CravenPut another way, dogs can detect some odors in parts per trillion. What does that mean in terms we might understand? Well, in her book Inside of a Dog, Alexandra Horowitz, a dog-cognition researcher at Barnard College, writes that while we might notice if our coffee has had a teaspoon of sugar added to it, a dog could detect a teaspoon of sugar in a million gallons of water, or two Olympic-sized pools worth. Another dog scientist likened their ability to catching a whiff of one rotten apple in two million barrels.\"I find it really astonishing that they're able to detect such minute odor discriminations.\"Experts have reported incredible true stories about the acuteness of dogs' sense of smell. There's the drug-sniffing dog that \"found\" a plastic container packed with 35 pounds of marijuana submerged in gasoline within a gas tank. There's the black lab stray from the streets of Seattle that can detect floating orca scat from up to a mile away across the choppy waters of Puget Sound. There's the cancer-sniffing dog that \"insisted\" on melanoma in a spot on a patient's skin that doctors had already pronounced cancer-free; a subsequent biopsy confirmed melanoma in a small fraction of the cells. And so on.A nose for odorsWhat do dogs have that we don't? For one thing, they possess up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about six million in us. And the part of a dog's brain that is devoted to analyzing smells is, proportionally speaking, 40 times greater than ours.Dogs' noses also function quite differently than our own. When we inhale, we smell and breathe through the same airways within our nose. When dogs inhale, a fold of tissue just inside their nostril helps to separate these two functions. \"We found that when airflow enters the nose it splits into two different flow paths, one for olfaction and one for respiration,\" says Brent Craven, a bioengineer at Pennsylvania State University who modeled airflow and odor transport using high-resolution MRI scans of a lab cadaver's nose . Craven and colleagues are working to reverse-engineer the canine nose, in part to aid in the design of artificial \"noses\" that can sniff out odors as well as man's best friend can.Figure 2: In the rear of a dog's nose lies the olfactory region , with its scroll-like tissues bristling with smell receptors. Respiratory regions appear in pink.                \u00a9 Courtesy of Brent CravenIn us humans, the sense of smell is relegated to a small region on the roof of our nasal cavity, along the main airflow path. So the air we smell just goes in and out with the air we breathe. In dogs, about 12 percent of the inspired air, Craven's team found, detours into a recessed area in the back of the nose that is dedicated to olfaction, while the rest of the incoming air sweeps past that nook and disappears down through the pharynx to the lungs. Within the recessed area, the odor-laden air filters through a labyrinth of scroll-like bony structures called turbinates . Like a whale's baleen sifting out krill, the turbinates sieve odor molecules based on different chemical properties. Olfactory receptors within the tissue that lines the turbinates, in turn, \"recognize\" these odor molecules by their shape and dispatch electrical signals to the brain for analysis.Exit strategyWhen we exhale through our nose, we send the spent air out the way it came in, forcing out any incoming odors. When dogs exhale, the spent air exits through the slits in the sides of their noses. The manner in which the exhaled air swirls out actually helps usher new odors into the dog's nose. More importantly, it allows dogs to sniff more or less continuously. In a study done at the University of Oslo in Norway, a hunting dog holding its head high into the wind while in search of game sniffed in a continuous stream of air for up to 40 seconds, spanning at least 30 respiratory cycles.\"It is a really big issue as to how in the heck dogs are doing it.\"We can't wiggle our nostrils independently. Dogs can. This, along with the fact that the so-called aerodynamic reach of each of their nostrils is smaller than the distance between the nostrils , helps them to determine which nostril an odor arrived in. This aids them in locating the source of smells\u2014we've all seen dogs on an interesting scent weave back and forth across its invisible trail.A second olfactory systemOn top of all this, dogs have a second olfactory capability that we don't have, made possible by an organ we don't possess: the vomeronasal organ, also known as Jacobson's organ. Located in the bottom of a dog's nasal passage, Jacobson's organ picks up pheromones, the chemicals unique to each animal species that advertise mating readiness and other sex-related details.Figure 3: When a dog breathes in , it can tell which nostril an odor arrived in because each nostril's \"aerodynamic reach\"  is so small. When a dog breathes out , the expired air blows out the side slits in such a way as to augment the sampling of new odors.                \u00a9 Courtesy of Brent CravenThe pheromone molecules that the organ detects\u2014and their analysis by the brain\u2014do not get mixed up with odor molecules or their analysis, because the organ has its own nerves leading to a part of the brain devoted entirely to interpreting its signals. It's as if Jacobson's organ had its own dedicated computer server.Track mastersIf dog's basic smelling skills amaze us, what they manage to achieve with those skills is truly astounding.Take tracking, for example. Deborah Wells and Peter Hepper of the Animal Behaviour Centre at Queen's University Belfast, in Northern Ireland, showed in one study that dogs brought in at right angles to a trail recently walked by a person could determine the direction that person took from as few as five steps. In other words, the first step in the direction the person walked has a little less odor than subsequent steps, because its odor molecules have begun to diffuse into the air. \"I find it really astonishing, kind of mind-boggling, that they're able to detect such minute odor discriminations,\" Horowitz says.Receive emails about upcoming NOVA programs and related content, as well as featured reporting about current events through a science lens.Scent-tracking dogs take such tracking to the extreme, routinely accomplishing remarkable feats in unfamiliar environments and on the trail of unfamiliar people such as missing persons. \"It is a really big issue as to how in the heck dogs are doing it, that is, how they are tracking a so-called gradient,\" Walker says. \"They're able to come to a branch point in the woods and say, 'Okay, I think little Sally ran this way. Something happened, and I need to make a decision.' That's pretty amazing if you think about it from an engineering standpoint, because little Sally's odors aren't the only thing there. There's changing wind, changing humidity. There are other odors\u2014a deer defecated over here, and over here there's some urine from a rabbit. And somehow that dog is able to say, 'Yeah, but I'm focusing on little Sally.'\"As it moves along the ground, the bloodhound's giant, flappy ears help fan up odors to its nose, one reason the breed is the superstar of scent-tracking.                \u00a9 Luis Santana/iStockphotoOpen questionsSuch mysteries are the spice for dog researchers. In a 2003 study, for instance, Wells and Hepper found that dogs led at right angles to a human-laid trail one hour after the trail was walked identified the correct direction of those trails that had been laid from left to right more frequently than those laid from right to left.\"The dog has distinguished you.\"\"This was an interesting result, and I'm not too sure what is going on here,\" Wells told me in an email. \"It is possibly related to lateral bias\u2014we know that dogs show strong motor preferences, with male dogs using their left paws more than female dogs, who, by contrast, tend to use their right paws more.\" Some studies on other species show that lateral biases can extend to the olfactory system, she says, and further research is in order with dogs.A marked manAnd what of Jones and my friend Burk? When I told Horowitz about my dog's behavior\u2014which always caught me and Burk equally off guard\u2014and I asked why Jones might have done it, she laughed and said, \"I cannot tell you. There are some places my science does not go.\" She could theorize, she said: Dogs mark with urine at places they think a lot of other dogs are going to smell, or maybe because there's something desirable or interesting about that place. Perhaps Burk already smelled pretty fragrantly of something else, she offered.Regardless of why, I said, Burk should have felt honored by such treatment, right? Horowitz laughed again. \"He certainly shouldn't have seen it as an insult,\" she said. \"The dog has distinguished you.\"", "                                                                                                        What do dog noses have that humans don't? They possess up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about six million in us. And the part of a dog's brain that is devoted to analyzing smells is about 40 times greater than ours. Dogs also have something called neophilia, which means they are attracted to new and interesting odors.\u00a0Dogs possess a sense of smell many times more sensitive than even the most advanced man-made instrument. Powerful enough to detect substances at concentrations of one part per trillion\u2014a single drop of liquid in 20 Olympic-size swimming pools. With training, dogs can sniff out bombs and drugs, pursue suspects, and find dead bodies. And more and more, they\u2019re being used experimentally to detect human disease\u2014cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis, and now, malaria\u2014from smell alone.Dogs' noses also function quite differently than our own. When we inhale, we smell and breathe through the same airways within our nose. When dogs inhale, a fold of tissue just inside their nostril helps to separate these two functions.When we exhale through our nose, we send the spent air out the way it came in, forcing out any incoming odors.

Dogs\u2019 sense of smell seems to be the main sense, allowing them to not only gather both current and historical information about their surrounding environment, but also to find the source of the smell, which is crucial for locating food, danger, or partners for reproduction. Dogs can be trained by humans to use their olfactory abilities in a variety of fields, with a detection limit often much lower than that of sophisticated laboratory instruments. The specific anatomical and physiological features of dog olfaction allow humans to achieve outstanding results in the detection of drugs, explosives, and different illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes, or infectious disease. This article provides an overview of the anatomical features and physiological mechanisms involved in the process of odor detection and identification, as well as behavioral aspects of canine olfaction and its use in the service of humans in many fields.AbstractOlfaction in dogs is crucial for gathering important information about the environment, recognizing individuals, making decisions, and learning. It is far more specialized and sensitive than humans\u2019 sense of smell. Using the strength of dogs\u2019 sense of smell, humans work with dogs for the recognition of different odors, with a precision far exceeding the analytical capabilities of most modern instruments. Due to their extremely sensitive sense of smell, dogs could be used as modern, super-sensitive mobile area scanners, detecting specific chemical signals in real time in various environments outside the laboratory, and then tracking the odor of dynamic targets to their source, also in crowded places. Recent studies show that dogs can detect not only specific scents of drugs or explosives, but also changes in emotions as well as in human cell metabolism during various illnesses, including COVID-19 infection. Here, we provide an overview of canine olfaction, discussing aspects connected with anatomy, physiology, behavioral aspects of sniffing, and factors influencing the olfactory abilities of the domestic dog .Keywords: dogs, olfaction, behavior, chemical communication, disease detection, COVID-191. Introduction The sense of smell, used for chemical communication, is present in most creatures of the animal kingdom, and allows for the detection and recognition of chemical signals. Although dogs interact with their world via all of their senses, olfaction seems to be one of the most important because it provides information not only about the current status of the environment, but can also allow detection of signals from the past . This complex network of mixtures of smells creates a three-dimensional image of the surrounding world across time, playing a key role in maintaining such basic life activities as finding food, recognizing threats, or finding a reproductive partner. There is some evidence that olfaction is one of the first senses to be active, even allowing prenatal olfactory learning . In most mammals, including dogs, there are two main parts of the olfactory system: the main olfactory epithelium  and the vomeronasal organ . The MOE is located in the usually pigmented part of the mucosa in the caudo-dorsal region of the nasal cavity, and the VNO lies between the nasal and oral cavity, near the vomer bone, just above the roof of the mouth. The nasopalatine duct, which starts behind the upper incisors on the palate, connects the mouth with the VNO, which is a tubular, elongated organ, separated by the nasal septum . In dogs, as in other species , the mechanism of nasal airflow patterns during inhalation allows the acquisition of separate odor samples in each nostril, allowing bilateral comparison of stimulus intensity and odor source localization  demonstrated, hemispheric specialization and chemo-signaling are also involved in the process of chemical communication between dogs and humans, allowing the transfer of information about emotional states . Moreover, Webber et al. .The olfactory epithelium consists of olfactory receptor cells , which are bipolar neurons extending out into the airspace to interact with odorants, as well as sustentacular and basal cells. The lifespan of an ORC is only a few weeks, and new ORCs arise from pluripotent basal cells which are capable of differentiating into either ORC or sustentacular cells . Sustentacular cells  enwrap the ORC, lending structural support, and are involved in the phagocytosis of dead neurons and in odorant and xenobiotic substances\u2019 transformation . Among the olfactory epithelium, olfactory glands , located in the mucosa, are responsible for the production of secretions to dissolve odorants and play a role in protection of the neuroepithelium against harmful agents reaching the nasal cavity with the collected air. In comparison to humans, dogs can detect significantly smaller concentrations of odorants due to a combination of olfactory neuron density and numbers, nasal airflow modification, and specificity of the central processing. Cilia are found on the ORC surface, with each ORC expressing only one type of olfactory receptor . Proper identification of an odor seems to involve the activation of a unique combination of ORs. The number of activated ORCs is thought to be responsible for determining the intensity of the odor . In addition to neurotransmitter receptors, ORCs also have receptors for hormones, and studies performed on humans and rodents have demonstrated that odor discrimination capacities could be influenced by circulating levels of hormones  .Impulses generated by olfactory cells as a consequence of odor detection impulses are transmitted, through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, by the olfactory nerves . The structure that constitutes the next level of the olfactory pathway is the olfactory bulb , which is located under the frontal lobes  .This schematic shows the traditional structure of the chemical substances detection system. Currently, the distinction between the so-called nose and the VNO in terms of the detection of odors and pheromones is not so obvious, and researchers tend to believe that both the \u201cnose\u201d receives pheromone signals and the VNO receives stimuli, with low-volatility odorant compounds suspended in the liquid phase.In comparison to some other species, the canine VNO lacks a VR2-based vomeronasal subsystem, as confirmed by the observation that the canine system does not express G\u03b1o and expresses G\u03b1i2 throughout the AOB as well as in the VNsE, and by the lack of functional VR2 genes in the canine genome  indicate that even though some odors can stimulate the nasal mucosa trigeminal nerve endings , in dogs, odor detection is implemented only through the olfactory neuroepithelium. 3. Internal and Environmental Factors Influencing Olfactory Skills: Olfaction Gene Polymorphism, Age, Sex, and Breed-Specific Olfactory Capacity3.1. Genetic ImplicationsThe largest mammalian gene superfamily is connected with the olfactory receptors. While in the human more than 50% are recognized as pseudogenes, only about 20% of OR genes are functionally inactive in dogs. The percentage of pseudogenes, as well as the frequency of specific gene polymorphisms, varies by breed, which could be one of the reasons for breed-specific olfactory capacity. It seems, therefore, that innate genetic factors may contribute to the occurrence of genetically determined lines of dogs with greater suitability for olfactory work . 3.2. BreedThe olfactory receptor  genes form the largest gene families in mammalian genomes. Taking into account this large gene pool and the huge variety of dog breeds, it was worth investigating the connection between olfactory capability and breeds. The genetic evaluation performed by Tacher et al.  within and between dog breeds focused on the gene polymorphism of the first element of the olfactory pathway\u2014the olfactory receptors. They found that \u201csome alleles are breed-specific , with some representing the major allele in the breeds concerned\u201d. In their study, Robin et al. . These results could suggest that in addition to genetic predisposition, some behavioral attributes, such as inherent motivation, eagerness to learn, trainability, and ability to work with people, could also significantly influence general canine olfactory capability. An appreciation of these two factors is thought to be at the root of the creation of Sulimov dogs, a jackal\u2013dog hybrid breed with unique olfactory abilities. The dog breeds used in the original development of this hybrid  were selected with the aim of improving trainability .Moreover, it is important to take into account that environmental conditions can change throughout the day, and that seasonal changes, especially transitional periods , can also influence the efficiency of the sniffing dogs. Changes in the physical environment, such as sudden landform changes , can also offer a further complication . Among environmental factors that could influence the sniffing performance , Jenkins et al. enumerates factors such as diet components negatively/decreasing  or positively/increasing olfactory acuity   and/or distortion of function . The mechanisms responsible for those events are thought to be connected with inhibition of odorant receptors. As Henkin  found that oral administration of metronidazole  degraded the ability of working dogs to detect the odors of explosives. Similarly, the use of steroids  caused a significant elevation in the olfactory detection threshold of dogs, without any observable structural alteration of the olfactory tissue using light microscopy . 4. Olfactory Behavior4.1. Sniffing vs. SmellingUnderstanding the physiological process of olfactory detection requires discrimination between two processes: sniffing and smelling. In this context, smelling is an implicit , effortless, non-cognitive process that is an accompaniment of breathing, facultatively bringing the stimulus to the dog\u2019s attention. In turn, sniffing could be defined as an explicit  described in detail the unique dogs\u2019 tracking behavior, well-known to the dog owners. In their work, they distinguished three phases:  an initial searching phase, during which the dog tried to find the track,  a deciding phase, during which it tried to determine the direction of the track, and  a tracking phase, in which it followed the track. The second phase is significantly longer than the others, but only five sequential footsteps are enough for a dog to determine the direction .5. The Use of Canine Olfactory SkillsThe sensitivity of canine olfaction is closely connected with the structure of their olfactory system, which is both quantitatively and qualitatively very different to that of humans  . They can detect these substances in very small amounts  and over long distances, where conventional equipment fails. This increases human safety by identifying the outermost borders of affected areas without exposure to dangerously high levels of toxins and enables the determination of source points for more efficient sampling of the contaminants .5.3. Detection of Other Living OrganismsPreventing the accidental spread of the Brown tree snake  in Guam is one example of dogs being used in biological safety and border control, with an average detection effectiveness of 62% , which massively affects the most important crop in the Middle East, Date palm  plantations . The dogs trained to find the termites at the early stages of development can discriminate between them and other burrowing insects  as well as identify wood damaged by the termites . Compared to electronic odor detectors, dogs detecting western subterranean termites  achieved a 98% success rate in identifying artificially placed colonies, while human-made devices achieved a much lower percentage . Specially trained dogs were also shown to have a very high success rate  in detecting screw-worm fly in both infected slugs and wounds on large animals infected via slugs , and grizzly bears  in Canada, described by Wasser et al. .Scat dogs are also used in studies of a very rare subspecies of kit fox called the San Joaquin  in the USA . The difficulty for dogs and humans in these studies is that the scats of the target fox have to be identified from other, very similar scats left by coyotes , skunks , and badgers . The study showed that dogs were capable of 100% accuracy in identifying the species, up to four times the success rate when compared to trained human trackers . Researchers are using the characteristics of certain dog breeds and their congenital hunting skills in rare species management programs. For example, a Border collie was used to catch the Aleutian cackling goose  in order to relocate them to predator-free islands in Alaska . In New Zealand, dogs have been used for over 100 years to locate many endangered species such as Kiwi bird , Kakapo , or Blue duck  . Possibilities for using the canine sense of smell seem to be unlimited.6. Recognition of the Physiological State by OlfactionThe recognition of the features of the physiological state of other individuals is an important skill in the context of social interaction. These skills could be divided into unlearned, occurring spontaneously, and learned . The first group would include the use of olfaction to recognize species, gender, and age, as well as physiological condition, such as phase of the reproductive cycle and emotions . What this type of study shows is a proof-of-concept that dogs can work with a large group of unfamiliar people and be able to detect, among those people, unifying and universal scents or other criteria-meeting stimuli.6.3. Dogs Detecting Diseases in Humans and AnimalsThe volatilome, understood as the composition of both the volatile organic compounds  in an organism and the VOCs reflecting its unique current metabolic state , can be used to detect diseases and the presence of specific pathogens. Those substances released in concentrations of ppb to ppt  and ppm to ppb  are certainly within a dog\u2019s capabilities of detection, since dogs\u2019 sense of smell demonstrated a lower limit of detection at concentrations of one part per trillion  .Upon the observation of spontaneously presented behaviors when dogs recognize some disturbances in the physiological state of another individual , people start to reinforce these behaviors and train these abilities. In the case of seizure in humans, there was a lot of doubt that dogs could recognize specific changes in the odor of the person, or warn the owner based on subtle changes in behavior that are imperceptible to humans . Detection of viral infections, such as COVID-19, by smell is not connected with the specific scent of the infectious agent, in this case the virus, but based on substances released by infected cells. The characteristic scent is strongly connected with the air exhaled by individuals infected with the virus. In exhaled air, VOCs are in the gas phase, and non-volatile molecules are included in liquid phases, such as exhaled breath condensate  and aerosols  . In scientific reports, dogs were trained to detect samples collected from patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and distinguish them from samples collected from healthy patients. The average diagnostic sensitivity in one of the studies was 82.63%, with 96.35% specificity, and the overall average detection rate achieved by the dogs was 94% . The dogs were presented with 1012 randomized samples, and correctly indicated 157 samples as positive and 792 samples as negative, with 33 samples incorrectly indicated as negative and 30 samples incorrectly indicated as positive  proved that not only natural infection, but also vaccination using an attenuated intranasal vaccine against influenza A , caused the huge number of changes in exhaled breath, which could suggest that changes in odors are connected strictly with the activation of the immune system. Currently, studies on the possibility of using dogs to distinguish between various viral infections of the human respiratory tract are ongoing.Even though the canine sense of smell has been used mostly as a tool for human disease detection, it has also been used successfully in the field of animal disease detection, although with a much more restricted range of application. Alasaad et al. .Another study reported a male German wirehaired pointer being trained to detect screwworm -infested animals, with a success rate of 100%  with training dummies and 94.7%  with screwworm-infested animals .Although dogs\u2019 capabilities to detect various diseases have been demonstrated in numerous studies, it still seems to be a controversial or even doubtful method. Thus, in some studies, researchers have tried to combine these methods with a \u201ctraditional\u201d analytical approach, such as VOC analysis, which can identify specific disease biomarkers. This model is thought to be useful because although the disease-detecting dogs  do not detect these particular chemical compounds, we believe that they will still detect markers specific for the disease substances. Combination of DDD with analytical methods allows the identification of relevant biomarkers or just confirmation of the differences in the chemical profile between healthy and sick individuals .7. Chemical Communication Influencing Animal BehaviorIn all these aspects of human use of canine olfactory ability, the final results, understood as an indication or identification of the odor , depend on the ability of the handler to recognize the specific behavioral signals presented by the animal. Those signals could be spontaneous or learned. This aspect of signaling the detection of a chemical marker seems to be especially important in the context of detection of substances that are naturally stimulating to dogs, such as canine sex pheromones, because in this case, the signs of natural arousal are the most desired reaction. That also seems to be important in the context of realizing what exactly the dog detects and points to\u2014the substance of interest itself, or an accompanying substance. In the study of Jezierski et al. , dogs were able to detect and point to samples collected from a female in estrus with satisfactory and significant accuracy. However, they did not usually present any signs of expected behavior\u2014in this case, arousal. This seems to be surprising, since the reaction towards pheromones is supposed to be characteristic, repetitive, and more importantly, subconscious, and therefore difficult to inhibit. In that study, the full range of behavior exhibited during contact with urine samples collected from a female in estrus was only observed when samples were placed in the imitation recto-vaginal region of an artificial dog model. This observation suggests that the behavioral reaction of dogs towards chemical signals can be modified by other environmental elements, which could provide the context. In other species, for example, ungulates and horses, easily visible specific behavior\u2014the flehmen response\u2014makes it easier to evaluate the behavioral reaction to the semiochemical signaling. Thus, the probable coexisting involvement of two systems: MOB and AOB , makes this model of detection more complex and more difficult for evaluation of dogs\u2019 behavior.Although the dog is a predator species, it can also become the prey in some circumstances. In that case, detection of the odor of the predator  could result in modification of the dog\u2019s behavior. What is interesting is that this behavioral reaction towards the secretions of potentially dangerous individuals can be identified spontaneously, in the absence of a previous bad experience. Samuel et al.  mentioned that although chemical cues  usually cause modification of animal behavior as an experience-based reaction, interspecific reactions enabling prey to detect adverse cues from predators that they have never previously been in contact with have been documented. It is worth mentioning that in this case, the observed behavioral parameter is not increased interest  but rather avoidance behavior of the area marked with a particular odor.Many different physiological and behavioral parameters used to be included when evaluating the influence of the various chemical signals on the signal-receiver\u2019s behavior. In dogs, the most common parameter, after adopting a specific learned body position or vocalization , is sniffing time .8. Novel Methods of Canine Olfaction Evaluation\u2014fMRI StudyWhen the sense of smell as well as semiochemical communication began to be studied in humans using modern methods of brain function visualization, the idea of a similar study in dogs arose. As in humans, a detailed fMRI evaluation of the reaction of the dog brain to odors confirmed the activation of those regions of the brain previously suggested to be responsible for odor detection. However, it should be mentioned that most of these studies specifically focused on those particular areas of the brain, thus activation of other regions of the brain could potentially have been missed. Another potentially useful approach is the resting state examination protocol , which has been used to map regional interactions in the brain in the absence of a task. Although the first of this type of study in both un-sedated and sedated dogs has been published, it did not include an olfaction evaluation, as was performed in human studies .One of the advantages of fMRI is the possibility of obtaining a detailed evaluation of the brain\u2019s reaction to a mixture of odors or to identify the particular brain region activated by odors connected with some features , studies that would be difficult to carry out using traditional, behavioral methods of examination . The use of brain visualization necessarily excludes the simultaneous evaluation of behavioral events, which could by misinterpretation  lead to false conclusions. However, this kind of method still has its own limitations that could also lead to the improper interpretation of results. The necessity of using specially trained dogs is another disadvantage of this method. Thus, in the future, a combination of the more traditional, behavioral methods, together with the sophisticated methods of brain activity visualization, will be required.9. Limitations in Canine Detection\u2014A Critical AssessmentAlthough a number of publications and studies have confirmed the high applicability of the canine sense of smell in many fields, it must also be pointed out that all methods using dogs as detectors still have limitations, and reports of low efficiency, false positives, as well as false negatives, have unfortunately been taken as an indication of limited usefulness, overshadowing some quite spectacular achievements The key problem in using dogs for detection is that they are living animals, so there are a number of variables that can influence their performance, including their state of health  which can affect both their physical and mental condition , as well as mood, lifestyle, diurnal rhythm, stressful situations, traumatic experiences at work, psychophysical activity, rest, sleep, circadian rhythm, sexual cycle, and many more.All these types of factors affect every living organism, and thus can potentially create artefacts. In addition, there is a training factor. The learning process is continuous, so going through training does not necessarily mean that a dog will remember all the skills it acquired during training , and it is also constantly learning new skills. In addition, the selection of training methods is crucial for the dog\u2019s future skills. Sometimes, training produces a useful effect, and other times quite the opposite. Therefore, dogs that were trained to detect narcotics were beginning to show, for example, various types of foils and adhesive tapes, which are very often wrapped around drugs. Thus, they generalized labeling responses to other, accompanying odors. In addition, in connection with their desire to obtain reinforcement, dogs often give false positives when trying to force this attention. Proper training and regular controlled application of the scent significantly reduce this type of behavior, but do not completely eliminate it.An issue which should always be considered during training, as well as during task performance, is the avoidance of sample contamination. Contamination of the sample  is a very serious mistake, responsible for the false results when it is not well-recognized. In such a case, the error attributed to the dog was instead a methodological error, for which the person who incorrectly carried out the sample preparation procedure was responsible. Even samples that were technically collected following the same procedure can still vary in their scent background . Although it has been suggested that the amount of the substance or the sample size could also influence the level of detection, Lazarowski et al. stated that beliefs that the amount of odor available can be easily altered by increasing the mass are not correct, because the amount of odorant emitted from a given substance is also related to the substance\u2019s vapor pressure and other factors, including environmental temperature, humidity, etc. . Other factors such as the effects of the dog\u2019s routine, the use of cues other than olfactory ones , and the non-verbal communication between handler and dog have also been mentioned . In the case of diabetes-alerting dogs , the conclusion that adoption of this kind of animal can be beneficial to the owner suffering from diabetes has been discussed in a few studies that highlighted numerous doubts regarding their effectiveness and the mechanism of detection   showed that 87% of dogs trained to detect potassium chlorate  as a component of explosive material did not correctly signal the presence of one or more PC-based explosive mixtures out of a sample size of four.Another important element in the consideration of dogs\u2019 olfactory skills and the effectiveness of odor detection is that many studies only used a small group of animals , and so generalization of the results to the sniffing dogs\u2019 population can be confusing. In their review of methodological approaches, Johnen et al.  reported that in 14 studies involving sniffing dogs, the average number of dogs per study was 4.6, with a range of 1  to 10 . A complex, critical review of the various factors influencing canine odor detection skills has been presented by Hayes et al. . The combination and interrelationships of canine physiology and training methodologies, as well as factors such as cultural, legal, and scientifically established domains, were identified as elements which should be taken into account when discussing the usefulness of dogs as detectors. There was also some attention paid to the issue of the relationship between dog and handler and factors such as the canines\u2019 ability to recognize their handler\u2019s facial expressions. The role of the handler in a successful olfactory detection process could also be connected with the rate of positive reinforcers  offered to the dog. The motivation of a sniffing dog could also decrease when objectives were less likely to be found. The issue of the dog\u2019s motivation is also thought to be an important element because dogs work for the reward, and over time they could try to find easier ways to obtain a reward, for example by trying to guess or pointing to the target by chance, etc. Thus, continuous training and verification of the accuracy of detection is a necessary, indispensable element in maintaining the detection capabilities of dogs detecting odors.A very interesting concept related to the bilateral interaction between handler and sniffing dogs has been proposed by Lit et al., who postulated that the handler\u2019s beliefs affect the outcome of scent detection by the dog .In the creation of a proper environment for a study, it is very unlikely that all potentially disturbing factors can be avoided, especially those related to sample volatility, therefore if the task is performed in the field, all of these factors must be recorded rather than controlled.10. ConclusionsDogs have been supporting people around the world for years by searching for various types of odors. The potential of using the canine\u2019s sense of smell is very wide and is still developing in new directions.Overall, the mechanism of olfactory detection and the ensuing innate canine olfactory abilities make them more sensitive detectors than the best man-made analytical instruments. However, some issues make it an instrument whose credibility is constantly subjected to doubt, and so its use is not as widespread as might be expected. The most important issues influencing the efficiency of the results of canine olfactory work are presented below .Factors affecting the efficiency of canine olfactory detection.The biggest problem with the objective assessment of canine detectors is that as a living organism, they are constantly changing, depending on the external environment. It must be understood that the use of canine olfactory skills can only be helpful if the biological character of the \u201cdetector\u201d is always considered, and the handler is familiar with both the dog\u2019s personality and other aspects of canine physiology. The final results of this teamwork can be affected if the dog is experiencing boredom, fatigue, lack of appropriate stimuli, no bond with the handler, or handler insensitivity to the signals sent by the dog, in addition to other factors such as health status or age .On the other hand, the issue of proper design of scientific experiments as well as a practical training schedule and daily dog work may reduce the risk of mistakes made by dogs and humans. For this purpose, reliable, detailed described procedures must be developed. They must include elements such as using as many dogs as possible , the use of sample randomization, the use of new samples in testing  that dogs have never smelled before, double-blind testing, appropriately selected and clearly presented statistical methods, and objective discussion of the results .However, there are some issues that cannot be eliminated. These include, among others, the individual characteristics of both the dog and the handler, which are not subject to standardization procedures . This represents a large difference from analytical devices which always follow standardization procedures.The compilation of the laboratory methods related to the olfactory skills of odor-detecting dogs is one approach that would improve the efficiency of detection of searched substances, and could even offer a step towards the identification of the particular compounds or the collection of sufficient data for additional discrimination between positive and negative samples .AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Sharon Mortimer. for proofreading and editing the text.Author ContributionsWriting\u2014original draft preparation: A.K.-K., M.D., M.W., M.Z. and J.M.; data collection A.K.-K., M.D., M.W., M.Z., J.M. and K.B.; visualization A.K.-K. and M.W.

Noses vary, but they all have one thing in common. Noses are key to canine survival. Why are noses important to dogs?The canine nose does more than smell the roses. While humans primarily depend on their vision, dogs use both sight and smell to assess their surroundings and communicate. People spend more time interpreting visual data than olfactory information. Dogs are just the opposite. Dogs devote lots of brain power to interpreting smells. They have more than 100 million sensory receptor sites in the nasal cavity compared to 6 million in people, and the area of the canine brain devoted to analyzing odors is about 40 times larger than the comparable part of the human brain. In fact, it has been estimated that dogs can smell anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 times better than people. Do noses \u201ctalk\u201d?While noses do not actually speak, they do communicate. With a single sniff, noses interpret an entire story without words by using amines and acids emitted by dogs as the basis for chemical communication. The chemical aromas communicate what a dog likes to eat, and identify gender and mood. By simply smelling, a dog can determine if a new friend is male or female, happy or aggressive, healthy or ill. Dogs get a general idea about each other with a quick sniff, but get more detailed information by getting up close and personal. That is why some dogs sniff private parts of the anatomy! Dogs also have a good scent memory that can identify other dogs they have not seen for years, and even remember which of them was the dominant member of the pair. When dogs belonging to the same family are separated for a while, they use sense of smell to catch up on things. Changes in odors may convey where the dog went, what he ate, and what he did. When in a new territory, a dog can sniff a tree and determine what other dogs live in the neighborhood. They can smell a visitor\u2019s pant-leg and get a good impression of where the person lives and whether he has pets at home. Dogs also have a great homing instinct that depends on their ability to smell. Since dogs move their nostrils independently, they can determine the direction of an odor and use their sense of smell like a compass.  \"The dog\u2019s sense of smell is so adept that a blind dog has much less difficulty adjusting to the loss of vision than a human does.\"  Humans each have a unique innate scent that enables dogs to tell one person from another. Our dogs do not need to see us to identify us. The dog\u2019s sense of smell is so adept that a blind dog has much less difficulty adjusting to the loss of vision than a human does. Dogs also sense fear and anxiety via their noses. When we are stressed or scared, we secrete the fight-or-flight hormone, adrenaline, which dogs detect even though we can not smell it. When we are anxious, we also have increased heart rate and blood flow which carries body chemicals to the skin surface where dogs can pick them up more easily. So, there is no use trying to mask your true feelings from your canine companion. His sense of smell will not be fooled. Why do dogs \u201csmell better\u201d than humans?Unlike humans, dogs have an additional olfactory tool that increases their ability to smell. Jacobsen\u2019s organ  is a special part of the dog\u2019s olfactory apparatus located inside the nasal cavity and opens into the roof of the mouth behind the upper incisors. This amazing organ serves as a secondary olfactory system designed specifically for chemical communication. The nerves from Jacobsen\u2019s organ lead directly to the brain and are different from the other nerves in the nose in that they do not respond to ordinary smells. In fact, these nerve cells respond to a range of substances that often have no odor at all. In other words, they work to detect \u201cundetectable\u201d odors.  \"With a quick sniff, a pup placed between two females will migrate to the mother that gave birth to him.\"  Jacobsen\u2019s organ communicates with the part of the brain that deals with mating. By identifying pheromones, it provides male and female dogs with the information they need to determine if a member of the opposite sex is available for breeding. It also enhances a newborn pup\u2019s sense of smell so he can find his mother\u2019s milk source, and allows a pup to distinguish his mother from other nursing dogs. With a quick sniff, a pup placed between two females will migrate to the mother that gave birth to him. Pups also have heat sensors in their noses that help them locate their mothers if they wander away. The two separate parts of the dog\u2019s odor detection system, the nose and Jacobsen\u2019s organ, work together to provide delicate sensibilities that neither system could achieve alone. When the dog curls his lips and flares his nostrils, he opens up Jacobsen\u2019s organ, increases the exposure of the nasal cavity to aromatic molecules and essentially becomes a remarkably efficient smelling machine. Why do dogs have wet noses?The canine nose works best when it is damp. The wet outer nose and mucus-covered nasal canal efficiently capture scent particles. Moisture is so important to the canine sense of smell, that dogs will lick their noses when they become dry. Smart canines do not want to miss out on important information due to a dry nose!

This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used commonly in cleaning products and smelling salts.Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. When this happens, it is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia.\u00a0People most often encounter ammonia as a liquid chemical in cleaning products. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns back into a gas. Ammonia is also commonly used in fertilizers for farm crops, lawns and plants.For industrial and agricultural purposes, ammonia is often shipped as a liquefied, compressed gas.\u00a0This is commonly called anhydrous ammonia as it has no water.Ammonia occurs naturally in the atmosphere.\u00a0 Ammonia is formed in the body during the decomposition of organic materials. Bacteria found in the intestines can also produce ammonia.Can ammonia be poisonous?Ammonia has a very strong odor. If ammonia cannot be smelled, it is probably not enough to be harmful.\u00a0 If you can smell ammonia, then health effects are possible with eye, nose or throat irritation being the most common effects. Leave an area that smells like ammonia for fresh air.\u00a0Ventilate the area to clear the ammonia.If you get ammonia in your eyes or if ammonia is swallowed, then call the Tennessee Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222.Where is ammonia in the environment?Ammonia occurs naturally in the environment. Ammonia does not last very long in the environment. It is rapidly taken up by plants, bacteria and animals. Ammonia serves as a nutrient for plants and bacteria. It is an important source of nitrogen needed by plants and animals. Ammonia does not build up in the food chain.For industrial and agricultural purposes, ammonia is often shipped as a liquefied, compressed gas. Ammonia is used in commercial refrigeration. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields.Where might people be exposed to ammonia?Since ammonia occurs naturally in the environment, we are regularly exposed to low levels of it in the air, soil and water. Harmful exposures to ammonia could come from cleaning products or commercial applications.People may be exposed to ammonia gas outdoors in the air from leaks and spills at production plants or storage facilities. It could leak from pipelines, tank trucks, railcars, ships and barges that transport ammonia. Higher levels of ammonia in the air may occur when fertilizer with ammonia compounds is applied to farm fields. Farmers, cattle ranchers and people who raise other types of livestock or poultry can be exposed to ammonia from decaying manure. Some manufacturing processes also use ammonia.People may be exposed to ammonia indoors while using household products that contain ammonia such as cleaning solutions, window cleaners, floor waxes and smelling salts. Remember to ventilate rooms when you clean with ammonia and dilute it as recommended on the label. Never mix ammonia with bleach. Keep chemical cleaners out of reach of children to prevent exposure and poisoning.Ammonia can also be released into the household air when pets urinate on rugs and when litter boxes are not changed often enough.Some people could be exposed to ammonia at a job site. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration  has a workplace standard for ammonia. If you might be exposed to lots of ammonia on the job, you may need special hazardous chemical training and personal protective equipment.What are some cleaning alternatives to ammonia?A chemical-free home is part of a healthy home. There are several alternative cleaning products that can be used in place of ammonia. Mixing natural products such as water with vinegar makes a good cleaner. Also, consider using baking soda. Other non-toxic cleaners, such as citrus-based cleaners, are widely available in retail stores.How does ammonia enter and leave the body?Ammonia can enter the body if you breathe ammonia gas or if you swallow water or food containing ammonium salts. Most of the ammonia that enters our body is from food or water that rapidly changes into other substances that will not harm us. You can breathe in ammonia when using cleaning products. Most ammonia that enters the body leaves in urine within a couple of days.Larger amounts of ammonia may enter the body of people exposed from an ammonia spills or gas leak. There is no antidote for acute ammonia poisoning, but ammonia's effects can be treated. Persons who have experienced serious signs and symptoms may need to be hospitalized. Most people recover.What are possible health effects of ammonia?Ammonia is not hazardous to health at concentrations typically found in the environment.\u00a0At higher concentrations ammonia can be harmful.\u00a0The most common health effect is irritation to the eyes, nose or throat.If swallowed, ammonia will cause pain and burning in the throat and stomach.If touched, ammonia can cause irritation or burns to the eyes or skin.If breathed in, ammonia can irritate the respiratory tract and can cause coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Inhalation of ammonia can also cause nose and throat irritation.People can smell the pungent odor of ammonia in air at about 5 parts of ammonia in\u00a0a million parts of air .According to World Health Organization , continuous exposure to 25 parts per million  of ammonia in the air does not result in a significant increase in blood levels of ammonia in the body.According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , the least amount of ammonia\u00a0which is found to be irritating to the eyes, nose and throat of the most sensitive individuals\u00a0is 50 parts per million .There is no evidence that ammonia causes cancer.Frostbite can occur with exposure to anhydrous ammonia.Exposure to very high concentrations of ammonia gas can cause pulmonary edema, upper respiratory irritation, tearing of the eyes, increased pulse rate and increased blood pressure.Death has been reported after an exposure to 10,000 ppm for an unknown duration.There is no evidence that exposure to the levels of ammonia found in the environment\u00a0causes birth defects or other developmental effects.Because ammonia is a respiratory tract irritant, persons who are hyper reactive to other\u00a0respiratory irritants or are asthmatic, may be more susceptible to the inhalation of ammonia.What should I do if I suspect an ammonia spill?If you suspect an ammonia spill, call the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation\u2019s environmental hotline number at 1-888-891-TDEC .Questions about ammonia and your health are best asked to your medical provider.\u00a0For general questions about ammonia, contact the Tennessee Department of Health\u2019s Environmental Epidemiology Program at\u00a0eep.health@tn.gov\u00a0or 615-741-7247 or 1-800-404-3006.        ", "                            With CKD, your kidneys aren\u2019t as efficient at removing waste from your body. One of those waste products, urea, typically exits the body through urine after being filtered out by healthy kidneys. If your kidneys aren\u2019t removing urea, your body will find other ways to remove it. One of those ways is to push the excess urea out through your breath. When the excess urea in your body reacts with saliva, it forms ammonia\u2013which you then exhale through your breath. If you have CKD, this is what gives your breath that ammonia scent. The medical name for this is \u201curemic fetor\u201d.\u00a0                                        ", "Urine does not usually have a strong odor to it. Some explanations for an ammonia odor are high amounts of waste in the urine, certain foods, dehydration, and infections.Urine is the body\u2019s liquid waste. It is made by the kidneys, which filter toxins out of the blood. Urine contains water, salt, urea, and uric acid primarily. Urea is expelled in the form of sweat through the body, while uric acid is the result of urine metabolism.Changes in urine smell and color offer insight into a person\u2019s health, diet, and lifestyle choices. These choices may contribute to an ammonia smell but are not the only causes.Most of the time, this occurrence is nothing to cause alarm. There are times, however, when ammonia-smelling urine indicates a health problem.DehydrationDehydration can cause an ammonia smell. Dehydration occurs when someone doesn\u2019t drink enough fluids or has a significant fluid loss due to vomiting or diarrhea. Ammonia odor happens when chemicals in urine are concentrated due to a lack of water.In addition to an ammonia-like odor, another telltale sign of dehydration is bubbles in a person\u2019s urine. And if someone is dehydrated, their urine is dark honey or brown color, rather than a pale yellow or gold.Urinary tract infectionsAccording to research from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, urinary tract infections  are the most common bacterial infections worldwide, affecting up to 150 million people each year.Additional figures for the United States include 10.5 million doctor visits and up to 3 million emergency room visits for UTI symptoms.UTIs tend to affect people born female more, but people born male can also develop UTIs. These infections are the result of bacteria entering the urinary tract. The bacteria make urine smell unpleasant and cause it to be cloudy or bloody.PregnancyPregnant people have a higher risk for UTIs, increasing their chances of having ammonia-smelling urine. One report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  finds up to 8% of pregnant women experience UTIs.UTIs can cause serious pregnancy complications, including premature labor, low birth weight, and sepsis. Hence, pregnant people should let their doctors know if they experience unpleasant-smelling urine, especially if the smell resembles ammonia.Pregnancy vitamins can also create a smell of ammonia in the urine. Smelly urine from taking vitamins usually goes away after a short time.In the absence of other symptoms, such as pain with urination, cloudy or dark urine color, or unusual frequency of urination, there is usually little reason for concern. But recurring ammonia odor in pregnancy should still be brought to a doctor\u2019s attention.MenopauseMenopause can also increase a person\u2019s risk for UTIs and ammonia-smelling odor, resulting from drops in the female hormone estrogen and loss of vaginal flora, which are the natural and healthy bacteria living in the vagina. Both these changes may cause ammonia-smelling urine.A further possibility is diet changes during menopause, which can cause an ammonia odor.DietDiet is the most common cause of ammonia-smelling urine in all people. Certain foods, medications, and vitamins can cause changes in urine smell and color.Asparagus is commonly linked with an ammonia smell, as are large amounts of vitamin B6. Similarly, foods high in protein can increase urine\u2019s acidic properties and cause it to have an ammonia smell.When diet is the cause of ammonia-smelling urine, the odor disappears once a person eliminates food triggers from their diet. Odor caused by something a person has eaten is usually nothing to worry about.Kidney or bladder stonesAnyone who develops kidney or bladder stones may experience ammonia-smelling urine.When stones pass through the urinary tract, the risk for UTIs increases, and they can cause urine to have an ammonia smell.Kidney diseaseKidney disease causes chemicals in urine to become concentrated and to cause a smell resembling ammonia. Kidney dysfunction can also cause high bacteria and protein levels in the urine, which will contribute to a foul ammonia smell.Liver diseaseLike the kidneys, the liver is responsible for removing toxins from the body and helping it digest food. Infections and diseases of the liver can produce high ammonia levels in the urine and the accompanying pungent odor.Ammonia levels in blood and urine will increase when the liver is not working as it should. Any continued ammonia odor in urine should be checked by a doctor.If ammonia-smelling urine occurs every once in a while, it is rarely a reason for concern. However, if the ammonia odor is accompanied by pain or symptoms of infection, including fever, it is time to see a doctor.A doctor will want to know:how long urine has had an odorhow often ammonia odor occursother symptoms, including blood in urine, back pain, fever, pain with urination, and urgencyA doctor will likely do a physical exam and request urine samples and blood work.Urine is examined for blood, bacteria, and kidney or bladder stone pieces. Usually, urine testing and blood work can help a doctor make a diagnosis.A doctor may also request imaging studies to test for kidney, bladder, or liver abnormalities.Treatments depend on the contributing cause. When diet is causing the odor, lifestyle changes can keep urine smelling and looking healthy.Stay hydratedDrinking between 9\u201313 cups of water daily can reduce the chances of dehydration.People who notice their urine is dark in color and has an ammonia smell should start drinking water to ensure they are not dehydrated.Making sure to avoid the common causes of dehydration, such as heat and sweating, can also help people stay hydrated.Cut down on diet triggersAnyone who consumes a lot of triggering foods can stop ammonia-smelling urine by cutting those foods out of their diet.Reducing the intake of offending vitamins and medications can also reduce urine odor.Pass urine oftenMost people urinate when their bladders are full. But urine that is held in can become more concentrated and have a foul odor. Not holding in urine will minimize ammonia odor and infections.Stay cleanPersonal hygiene of the genital area is vital when experiencing a strong ammonia-smelling odor. Ensuring genitals are cleaned well during bathing and completely dried afterward is essential.It is also a good idea to empty the bladder completely when urinating to avoid remnants of urine dripping onto clothing.
