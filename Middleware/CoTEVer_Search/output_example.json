                    "content": "They haven't got no noses, The fallen sons of Eve; Even the smell of roses Is not what they supposes; But more than mind discloses And more than men believe. —from \"The Song of the Quoodle,\" G.K. Chesterton My dog Jones used to do the most curious thing whenever my friend Burk visited my house. Jones was a mutt from the pound, so before we adopted him he might have picked up some unsavory habits. But he'd sidle over to Burk, rub up against him, and start to lift his leg on him.Jones, a greyhound-black lab mix who, bless his big heart, passed on at age 15 a few years ago, never did that with any other visitor. Burk didn't smell or wear stinky clothes, and he didn't antagonize or otherwise provoke Jones. Burk did have a dog of his own, a redbone coonhound named Hattie, but other visitors had dogs. In short, he shouldn't have stood out in any way from anyone else. But to Jones, Burk was like a fresh wall to a graffiti artist.Why? For me, Jones's behavior—which even a dog-cognition expert acknowledged was unusual—epitomizes the mystery that is dogs' sense of smell. What lies behind this astonishing capability of theirs, one that makes the world not a visual one as it is to us but a richly odoriferous one? How do their noses differ from ours, and what do their brains do differently? Finally, is there an answer to why Jones tried to pee on Burk every time he set foot in my place?Olympic sniffersDogs' sense of smell overpowers our own by orders of magnitude—it's 10,000 to 100,000 times as acute, scientists say. \"Let's suppose they're just 10,000 times better,\" says James Walker, former director of the Sensory Research Institute at Florida State University, who, with several colleagues, came up with that jaw-dropping estimate during a rigorously designed, oft-cited study. \"If you make the analogy to vision, what you and I can see at a third of a mile, a dog could see more than 3,000 miles away and still see as well.\"Figure 1: When a dog breathes in, the air separates into distinct paths, one  flowing into the olfactory area and the other  passing through the pharynx  to the lungs.                © Courtesy of Brent CravenPut another way, dogs can detect some odors in parts per trillion. What does that mean in terms we might understand? Well, in her book Inside of a Dog, Alexandra Horowitz, a dog-cognition researcher at Barnard College, writes that while we might notice if our coffee has had a teaspoon of sugar added to it, a dog could detect a teaspoon of sugar in a million gallons of water, or two Olympic-sized pools worth. Another dog scientist likened their ability to catching a whiff of one rotten apple in two million barrels.\"I find it really astonishing that they're able to detect such minute odor discriminations.\"Experts have reported incredible true stories about the acuteness of dogs' sense of smell. There's the drug-sniffing dog that \"found\" a plastic container packed with 35 pounds of marijuana submerged in gasoline within a gas tank. There's the black lab stray from the streets of Seattle that can detect floating orca scat from up to a mile away across the choppy waters of Puget Sound. There's the cancer-sniffing dog that \"insisted\" on melanoma in a spot on a patient's skin that doctors had already pronounced cancer-free; a subsequent biopsy confirmed melanoma in a small fraction of the cells. And so on.A nose for odorsWhat do dogs have that we don't? For one thing, they possess up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about six million in us. And the part of a dog's brain that is devoted to analyzing smells is, proportionally speaking, 40 times greater than ours.Dogs' noses also function quite differently than our own. When we inhale, we smell and breathe through the same airways within our nose. When dogs inhale, a fold of tissue just inside their nostril helps to separate these two functions. \"We found that when airflow enters the nose it splits into two different flow paths, one for olfaction and one for respiration,\" says Brent Craven, a bioengineer at Pennsylvania State University who modeled airflow and odor transport using high-resolution MRI scans of a lab cadaver's nose . Craven and colleagues are working to reverse-engineer the canine nose, in part to aid in the design of artificial \"noses\" that can sniff out odors as well as man's best friend can.Figure 2: In the rear of a dog's nose lies the olfactory region , with its scroll-like tissues bristling with smell receptors. Respiratory regions appear in pink.                © Courtesy of Brent CravenIn us humans, the sense of smell is relegated to a small region on the roof of our nasal cavity, along the main airflow path. So the air we smell just goes in and out with the air we breathe. In dogs, about 12 percent of the inspired air, Craven's team found, detours into a recessed area in the back of the nose that is dedicated to olfaction, while the rest of the incoming air sweeps past that nook and disappears down through the pharynx to the lungs. Within the recessed area, the odor-laden air filters through a labyrinth of scroll-like bony structures called turbinates . Like a whale's baleen sifting out krill, the turbinates sieve odor molecules based on different chemical properties. Olfactory receptors within the tissue that lines the turbinates, in turn, \"recognize\" these odor molecules by their shape and dispatch electrical signals to the brain for analysis.Exit strategyWhen we exhale through our nose, we send the spent air out the way it came in, forcing out any incoming odors. When dogs exhale, the spent air exits through the slits in the sides of their noses. The manner in which the exhaled air swirls out actually helps usher new odors into the dog's nose. More importantly, it allows dogs to sniff more or less continuously. In a study done at the University of Oslo in Norway, a hunting dog holding its head high into the wind while in search of game sniffed in a continuous stream of air for up to 40 seconds, spanning at least 30 respiratory cycles.\"It is a really big issue as to how in the heck dogs are doing it.\"We can't wiggle our nostrils independently. Dogs can. This, along with the fact that the so-called aerodynamic reach of each of their nostrils is smaller than the distance between the nostrils , helps them to determine which nostril an odor arrived in. This aids them in locating the source of smells—we've all seen dogs on an interesting scent weave back and forth across its invisible trail.A second olfactory systemOn top of all this, dogs have a second olfactory capability that we don't have, made possible by an organ we don't possess: the vomeronasal organ, also known as Jacobson's organ. Located in the bottom of a dog's nasal passage, Jacobson's organ picks up pheromones, the chemicals unique to each animal species that advertise mating readiness and other sex-related details.Figure 3: When a dog breathes in , it can tell which nostril an odor arrived in because each nostril's \"aerodynamic reach\"  is so small. When a dog breathes out , the expired air blows out the side slits in such a way as to augment the sampling of new odors.                © Courtesy of Brent CravenThe pheromone molecules that the organ detects—and their analysis by the brain—do not get mixed up with odor molecules or their analysis, because the organ has its own nerves leading to a part of the brain devoted entirely to interpreting its signals. It's as if Jacobson's organ had its own dedicated computer server.Track mastersIf dog's basic smelling skills amaze us, what they manage to achieve with those skills is truly astounding.Take tracking, for example. Deborah Wells and Peter Hepper of the Animal Behaviour Centre at Queen's University Belfast, in Northern Ireland, showed in one study that dogs brought in at right angles to a trail recently walked by a person could determine the direction that person took from as few as five steps. In other words, the first step in the direction the person walked has a little less odor than subsequent steps, because its odor molecules have begun to diffuse into the air. \"I find it really astonishing, kind of mind-boggling, that they're able to detect such minute odor discriminations,\" Horowitz says.Receive emails about upcoming NOVA programs and related content, as well as featured reporting about current events through a science lens.Scent-tracking dogs take such tracking to the extreme, routinely accomplishing remarkable feats in unfamiliar environments and on the trail of unfamiliar people such as missing persons. \"It is a really big issue as to how in the heck dogs are doing it, that is, how they are tracking a so-called gradient,\" Walker says. \"They're able to come to a branch point in the woods and say, 'Okay, I think little Sally ran this way. Something happened, and I need to make a decision.' That's pretty amazing if you think about it from an engineering standpoint, because little Sally's odors aren't the only thing there. There's changing wind, changing humidity. There are other odors—a deer defecated over here, and over here there's some urine from a rabbit. And somehow that dog is able to say, 'Yeah, but I'm focusing on little Sally.'\"As it moves along the ground, the bloodhound's giant, flappy ears help fan up odors to its nose, one reason the breed is the superstar of scent-tracking.                © Luis Santana/iStockphotoOpen questionsSuch mysteries are the spice for dog researchers. In a 2003 study, for instance, Wells and Hepper found that dogs led at right angles to a human-laid trail one hour after the trail was walked identified the correct direction of those trails that had been laid from left to right more frequently than those laid from right to left.\"The dog has distinguished you.\"\"This was an interesting result, and I'm not too sure what is going on here,\" Wells told me in an email. \"It is possibly related to lateral bias—we know that dogs show strong motor preferences, with male dogs using their left paws more than female dogs, who, by contrast, tend to use their right paws more.\" Some studies on other species show that lateral biases can extend to the olfactory system, she says, and further research is in order with dogs.A marked manAnd what of Jones and my friend Burk? When I told Horowitz about my dog's behavior—which always caught me and Burk equally off guard—and I asked why Jones might have done it, she laughed and said, \"I cannot tell you. There are some places my science does not go.\" She could theorize, she said: Dogs mark with urine at places they think a lot of other dogs are going to smell, or maybe because there's something desirable or interesting about that place. Perhaps Burk already smelled pretty fragrantly of something else, she offered.Regardless of why, I said, Burk should have felt honored by such treatment, right? Horowitz laughed again. \"He certainly shouldn't have seen it as an insult,\" she said. \"The dog has distinguished you.\""

Powerful enough to detect substances at concentrations of one part per trillion—a single drop of liquid in 20 Olympic-size swimming pools. With training, dogs can sniff out bombs and drugs, pursue suspects, and find dead bodies.

                    "content": "The nose is a prominent canine facial feature…long, short, black, pink. Noses vary, but they all have one thing in common. Noses are key to canine survival. Why are noses important to dogs?The canine nose does more than smell the roses. While humans primarily depend on their vision, dogs use both sight and smell to assess their surroundings and communicate. People spend more time interpreting visual data than olfactory information. Dogs are just the opposite. Dogs devote lots of brain power to interpreting smells. They have more than 100 million sensory receptor sites in the nasal cavity compared to 6 million in people, and the area of the canine brain devoted to analyzing odors is about 40 times larger than the comparable part of the human brain. In fact, it has been estimated that dogs can smell anywhere from 1,000 to 10,000 times better than people. Do noses “talk”?While noses do not actually speak, they do communicate. With a single sniff, noses interpret an entire story without words by using amines and acids emitted by dogs as the basis for chemical communication. The chemical aromas communicate what a dog likes to eat, and identify gender and mood. By simply smelling, a dog can determine if a new friend is male or female, happy or aggressive, healthy or ill. Dogs get a general idea about each other with a quick sniff, but get more detailed information by getting up close and personal. That is why some dogs sniff private parts of the anatomy! Dogs also have a good scent memory that can identify other dogs they have not seen for years, and even remember which of them was the dominant member of the pair. When dogs belonging to the same family are separated for a while, they use sense of smell to catch up on things. Changes in odors may convey where the dog went, what he ate, and what he did. When in a new territory, a dog can sniff a tree and determine what other dogs live in the neighborhood. They can smell a visitor’s pant-leg and get a good impression of where the person lives and whether he has pets at home. Dogs also have a great homing instinct that depends on their ability to smell. Since dogs move their nostrils independently, they can determine the direction of an odor and use their sense of smell like a compass.  \"The dog’s sense of smell is so adept that a blind dog has much less difficulty adjusting to the loss of vision than a human does.\"  Humans each have a unique innate scent that enables dogs to tell one person from another. Our dogs do not need to see us to identify us. The dog’s sense of smell is so adept that a blind dog has much less difficulty adjusting to the loss of vision than a human does. Dogs also sense fear and anxiety via their noses. When we are stressed or scared, we secrete the fight-or-flight hormone, adrenaline, which dogs detect even though we can not smell it. When we are anxious, we also have increased heart rate and blood flow which carries body chemicals to the skin surface where dogs can pick them up more easily. So, there is no use trying to mask your true feelings from your canine companion. His sense of smell will not be fooled. Why do dogs “smell better” than humans?Unlike humans, dogs have an additional olfactory tool that increases their ability to smell. Jacobsen’s organ  is a special part of the dog’s olfactory apparatus located inside the nasal cavity and opens into the roof of the mouth behind the upper incisors. This amazing organ serves as a secondary olfactory system designed specifically for chemical communication. The nerves from Jacobsen’s organ lead directly to the brain and are different from the other nerves in the nose in that they do not respond to ordinary smells. In fact, these nerve cells respond to a range of substances that often have no odor at all. In other words, they work to detect “undetectable” odors.  \"With a quick sniff, a pup placed between two females will migrate to the mother that gave birth to him.\"  Jacobsen’s organ communicates with the part of the brain that deals with mating. By identifying pheromones, it provides male and female dogs with the information they need to determine if a member of the opposite sex is available for breeding. It also enhances a newborn pup’s sense of smell so he can find his mother’s milk source, and allows a pup to distinguish his mother from other nursing dogs. With a quick sniff, a pup placed between two females will migrate to the mother that gave birth to him. Pups also have heat sensors in their noses that help them locate their mothers if they wander away. The two separate parts of the dog’s odor detection system, the nose and Jacobsen’s organ, work together to provide delicate sensibilities that neither system could achieve alone. When the dog curls his lips and flares his nostrils, he opens up Jacobsen’s organ, increases the exposure of the nasal cavity to aromatic molecules and essentially becomes a remarkably efficient smelling machine. Why do dogs have wet noses?The canine nose works best when it is damp. The wet outer nose and mucus-covered nasal canal efficiently capture scent particles. Moisture is so important to the canine sense of smell, that dogs will lick their noses when they become dry. Smart canines do not want to miss out on important information due to a dry nose!"

To really understand what dogs can do, let’s take an in-depth look at our canine companions’ superior sniffer.Dogs have a strong sense of smellScientists guess the dog’s sense of smell is somewhere between 10,000 to 100,000 times more acute than ours.1 One of the reasons a dog has such better smelling ability than us is the number of scent receptors. For every scent receptor a human has, a dog has about 50.Not all noses are created equalWhile all dog breeds have an excellent sense of smell, dogs with short noses, such as bulldogs, have less space for scent-detecting cells than dogs with a longer snout.The Best Nose Award goes to the bloodhound!This breed takes the lead with approximately 300 million scent receptors.

                    "content": "What is ammonia?At room temperature, ammonia is a colorless gas with a very pungent odor. This odor is familiar to many people because ammonia is used commonly in cleaning products and smelling salts.Ammonia gas can be dissolved in water. When this happens, it is called liquid ammonia or aqueous ammonia. People most often encounter ammonia as a liquid chemical in cleaning products. Once exposed to open air, liquid ammonia quickly turns back into a gas. Ammonia is also commonly used in fertilizers for farm crops, lawns and plants.For industrial and agricultural purposes, ammonia is often shipped as a liquefied, compressed gas. This is commonly called anhydrous ammonia as it has no water.Ammonia occurs naturally in the atmosphere.  Ammonia is formed in the body during the decomposition of organic materials. Bacteria found in the intestines can also produce ammonia.Can ammonia be poisonous?Ammonia has a very strong odor. If ammonia cannot be smelled, it is probably not enough to be harmful.  If you can smell ammonia, then health effects are possible with eye, nose or throat irritation being the most common effects. Leave an area that smells like ammonia for fresh air. Ventilate the area to clear the ammonia.If you get ammonia in your eyes or if ammonia is swallowed, then call the Tennessee Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222.Where is ammonia in the environment?Ammonia occurs naturally in the environment. Ammonia does not last very long in the environment. It is rapidly taken up by plants, bacteria and animals. Ammonia serves as a nutrient for plants and bacteria. It is an important source of nitrogen needed by plants and animals. Ammonia does not build up in the food chain.For industrial and agricultural purposes, ammonia is often shipped as a liquefied, compressed gas. Ammonia is used in commercial refrigeration. Ammonia is applied directly into soil on farm fields.Where might people be exposed to ammonia?Since ammonia occurs naturally in the environment, we are regularly exposed to low levels of it in the air, soil and water. Harmful exposures to ammonia could come from cleaning products or commercial applications.People may be exposed to ammonia gas outdoors in the air from leaks and spills at production plants or storage facilities. It could leak from pipelines, tank trucks, railcars, ships and barges that transport ammonia. Higher levels of ammonia in the air may occur when fertilizer with ammonia compounds is applied to farm fields. Farmers, cattle ranchers and people who raise other types of livestock or poultry can be exposed to ammonia from decaying manure. Some manufacturing processes also use ammonia.People may be exposed to ammonia indoors while using household products that contain ammonia such as cleaning solutions, window cleaners, floor waxes and smelling salts. Remember to ventilate rooms when you clean with ammonia and dilute it as recommended on the label. Never mix ammonia with bleach. Keep chemical cleaners out of reach of children to prevent exposure and poisoning.Ammonia can also be released into the household air when pets urinate on rugs and when litter boxes are not changed often enough.Some people could be exposed to ammonia at a job site. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration  has a workplace standard for ammonia. If you might be exposed to lots of ammonia on the job, you may need special hazardous chemical training and personal protective equipment.What are some cleaning alternatives to ammonia?A chemical-free home is part of a healthy home. There are several alternative cleaning products that can be used in place of ammonia. Mixing natural products such as water with vinegar makes a good cleaner. Also, consider using baking soda. Other non-toxic cleaners, such as citrus-based cleaners, are widely available in retail stores.How does ammonia enter and leave the body?Ammonia can enter the body if you breathe ammonia gas or if you swallow water or food containing ammonium salts. Most of the ammonia that enters our body is from food or water that rapidly changes into other substances that will not harm us. You can breathe in ammonia when using cleaning products. Most ammonia that enters the body leaves in urine within a couple of days.Larger amounts of ammonia may enter the body of people exposed from an ammonia spills or gas leak. There is no antidote for acute ammonia poisoning, but ammonia's effects can be treated. Persons who have experienced serious signs and symptoms may need to be hospitalized. Most people recover.What are possible health effects of ammonia?Ammonia is not hazardous to health at concentrations typically found in the environment. At higher concentrations ammonia can be harmful. The most common health effect is irritation to the eyes, nose or throat.If swallowed, ammonia will cause pain and burning in the throat and stomach.If touched, ammonia can cause irritation or burns to the eyes or skin.If breathed in, ammonia can irritate the respiratory tract and can cause coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. Inhalation of ammonia can also cause nose and throat irritation.People can smell the pungent odor of ammonia in air at about 5 parts of ammonia in a million parts of air .According to World Health Organization , continuous exposure to 25 parts per million  of ammonia in the air does not result in a significant increase in blood levels of ammonia in the body.According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration , the least amount of ammonia which is found to be irritating to the eyes, nose and throat of the most sensitive individuals is 50 parts per million .There is no evidence that ammonia causes cancer.Frostbite can occur with exposure to anhydrous ammonia.Exposure to very high concentrations of ammonia gas can cause pulmonary edema, upper respiratory irritation, tearing of the eyes, increased pulse rate and increased blood pressure.Death has been reported after an exposure to 10,000 ppm for an unknown duration.There is no evidence that exposure to the levels of ammonia found in the environment causes birth defects or other developmental effects.Because ammonia is a respiratory tract irritant, persons who are hyper reactive to other respiratory irritants or are asthmatic, may be more susceptible to the inhalation of ammonia.What should I do if I suspect an ammonia spill?If you suspect an ammonia spill, call the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation’s environmental hotline number at 1-888-891-TDEC .Questions about ammonia and your health are best asked to your medical provider. For general questions about ammonia, contact the Tennessee Department of Health’s Environmental Epidemiology Program at eep.health@tn.gov or 615-741-7247 or 1-800-404-3006."

                    "content": "With CKD, your kidneys aren’t as efficient at removing waste from your body. One of those waste products, urea, typically exits the body through urine after being filtered out by healthy kidneys. If your kidneys aren’t removing urea, your body will find other ways to remove it. One of those ways is to push the excess urea out through your breath. When the excess urea in your body reacts with saliva, it forms ammonia–which you then exhale through your breath. If you have CKD, this is what gives your breath that ammonia scent. The medical name for this is “uremic fetor”."

Why does urine smell?Urine can vary in color — and smell — based on the amount of waste products as well as fluids you take in over the course of the day. However, there are some out-of-the-ordinary smells that may indicate you need to seek medical treatment. One such example is a sweet smell to the urine, which can indicate excess glucose  in the urine.Another is the smell of ammonia, which has a strong, chemical-like smell. While urine that smells like ammonia isn’t always cause for concern, there are some instances where it can be.Waste products in urine often have an odor, but urine is usually diluted enough that the waste products don’t smell. However, if the urine becomes more concentrated — meaning there is a greater amount of waste products in relation to fluids — the urine is more likely to smell like ammonia.Urea is one of the waste products found in urine. It’s a byproduct of the breakdown of protein and can be broken down further to ammonia in certain situations. Therefore, many conditions that result in concentrated urine can cause urine that smells like ammonia.Conditions that can cause a person’s urine to smell like ammonia include:Bladder stonesStones in the bladder or kidneys can build up due to excess waste products in the bladder. Additional symptoms of bladder stones include:cloudy urineblood in the urinestomach paindark urineBladder stones themselves can be caused by a variety of conditions. Learn more about bladder stones.DehydrationNot having enough fluid circulating in the body means the kidneys are more likely to hold onto water, yet release waste products. As a result, the urine may be more concentrated and smell like ammonia. If your urine is darker in color and you’re passing only small amounts of urine, you may be dehydrated. Learn more about dehydration.Urinary tract infection A bladder infection or other infection impacting the urinary tract can lead to urine that smells like ammonia. Other symptoms associated with a UTI include:pain when urinatingstomach painfeeling like you need to urinate often without producing a significant amount of urineIn most cases UTIs are caused by bacteria. Learn more about UTIs.FoodSometimes urine smells like ammonia due to a unique combination of foods. This is not usually cause for concern unless it’s accompanied by other uncomfortable symptoms. Occasionally having urine that smells like ammonia isn’t usually cause for concern. You may need to drink more water to dilute your urine. However, if your symptoms are accompanied by pain or potential signs of infection, such as a fever, then you should see a doctor.The doctor will start by asking questions about your symptoms. These may include:How long has your urine smelled like ammonia?Are there times when your urine smells especially strong?Are you experiencing any other symptoms, such as blood in your urine, fever, back or flank pain, or pain when urinating?Your doctor will use these responses to consider the next diagnostic tests. Sometimes, a doctor will perform an exam to check a man’s prostate for signs of enlargement that could be affecting urination. They may also ask for a urine test. The urine sample is sent to a laboratory and then tested for the presence of bacteria, blood, or pieces of a bladder or kidney stone or other waste components. Usually this test, along with a description of your symptoms, can help a doctor diagnose the cause for urine that smells like ammonia.Your doctor may also order imaging studies where they test for abnormalities in the kidneys, bladder, or other areas that could be affecting the urine.If urine that smells like ammonia is caused by an underlying infection, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. These can reduce the incidence and overgrowth of bacteria in the urinary tract.You should also take steps to practice good bladder health, which can reduce the incidence of dehydration and the likelihood that you will get a UTI.Examples include drinking at least six 8-ounce glasses of water a day. Drinking a glass of cranberry juice a day or adding lemon to your water changes the urine’s acidity. This could be beneficial to your bladder health if you experience a lot of infections.Most cases of urine that smells like ammonia can be treated with fluids or antibiotic medications.Ideally, your urine should be pale yellow to straw-colored. If it remains darker than usual for longer than 24 hours, see a doctor. You should also always seek treatment if you believe you may have an underlying infection or other medical concern.Urine may smell like ammonia when it becomes concentrated with waste products. A variety of conditions can cause waste products to build up in urine, such as bladder stones, dehydration, and urinary tract infections. In most cases, urine that smells like ammonia can be treated with fluids or antibiotic medications."

                    "content": "Not all types of sweat have an odor. However, sometimes sweat can smell like ammonia. This can be due to a high protein diet, exercise, or health conditions such as kidney disease. The purpose of sweat is to help the body cool down. Sweat droplets transfer body heat onto the surface of the skin, where they evaporate. This can make the skin feel cool and reduce a person’s body temperature.This article explains why a person’s sweat may smell like ammonia and what treatment options are available.Sweat can act as a barrier against bacteria on the skin, and it can also moisturize the skin.Sweat contains water and sodium chloride, as well as small amounts of:potassiumcalciumammoniaurealactateethanolA person may sometimes be able to smell the ammonia content in their sweat.Sweat glands all over the body release sweat. There are three types of sweat glands, which are called the eccrine, apocrine, and apoeccrine glands.Eccrine glands are the most abundant across the body. This type of sweat gland produces the most sweat, but it does not have a smell.Apocrine glands are found in specific areas of the body, such as the breasts, face, scalp, perineum, and the underarms. The apocrine glands produce sweat that comes through hair follicles rather than through the pores on the skin. Sweat from apocrine glands can have an odor. It contains high levels of lipids, as well as sugars and ammonia.Apoeccrine glands are only located in the underarms. Apoeccrine glands release sweat onto the skin’s surface in the form of salt water.Sweat from apoeccrine glands is not thought to help regulate a person’s temperature as it cannot evaporate easily from the underarms. Ammonia  is a colorless gas that is a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen. It has a strong odor that smells like urine or sweat.Ammonia occurs naturally in water, soil, and the air, and is also found naturally in plants, animals, and the human body.The human body makes ammonia when it breaks down protein into amino acids. The liver then converts ammonia into urea before it leaves the body through urine or sweat.There are many possible causes of sweat smelling like ammonia. These include:DietA person’s diet can make their sweat smell like ammonia.A person who eats a diet high in protein but low in carbohydrates may produce ammonia that the body then releases in sweat.The body usually uses carbohydrates for energy by converting them into glucose because carbohydrates are the fastest energy supply. However, if there aren’t enough carbohydrates, the body will use protein for energy.Protein breaks down into amino acids, which the body converts into ammonia. The body then releases this ammonia through urine and sweat, which may produce an odor.Dehydration can also make the sweat smell like ammonia. This is because the body needs water to get rid of ammonia through sweat. If there is not enough water to dilute the ammonia as it is released by the body, the smell of ammonia may be stronger.ExerciseSome research suggests exercise affects ammonia levels in sweat. A 2007 study found that ammonia levels in sweat increased as a person exercised more intensely. A 2005 study found that while ammonia levels in sweat increased significantly during exercise, ammonia levels in sweat reduced over the 24 hour period after exercise and remained low after 72 hours. This suggests a person may find their sweat smells most strongly of ammonia during or just after exercise.Health conditionsCertain health conditions can cause a person’s body odor to change. They include:HyperhidrosisHyperhidrosis causes excessive sweating from the eccrine glands. A 2016 study estimated 15.3 million people in the United States live with hyperhidrosis.There are two types of hyperhidrosis:Primary focal hyperhidrosis: This type of hyperhidrosis can affect the underarms, hands, feet, and forehead. Primary focal hyperhidrosis is not due to an underlying health condition or a side effect from medication.Secondary hyperhidrosis: This type of hyperhidrosis is due to an underlying health condition or a side effect of medication.If a person sweats a lot, sweat may build up on their skin and interact with bacteria. This can cause an odor to develop, which may smell like ammonia.Kidney diseaseKidney disease can cause a person’s body odor to change.The kidneys are responsible for removing urea from the body. However, if the kidneys are not working properly, urea may enter into the bloodstream instead. This is called uremia, and is a serious symptom of kidney failure.If a person has high levels of urea in their body, the body may release urea through sweat and cause an odor.According to the National Kidney Foundation, the main causes of kidney disease are diabetes and high blood pressure, which accounts for up to 66% of cases.DiabetesA complication of diabetes is a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis .DKA develops when the body burns fat for energy if there is not enough insulin to use glucose in the cells.When the body burns fat for energy, it produces ketones. A type of ketone called acetone can make the breath smell fruity or change a person’s body odor.If the level of ketones becomes too high, the blood can become too acidic, which can be life-threatening.According to the American Diabetes Association, DKA is rare in people with type 2 diabetes, but it can still develop in anyone.DKA produces symptoms including:frequent urinationthirstvery dry mouthhigh blood sugar levelshigh ketone levels in urinevomitingTrichomycosisTrichomycosis is a bacterial infection that affects the hair in the underarms. According to a 2013 study, it can affect pubic hair in rare cases.The bacteria Corynebacterium causes trichomycosis and produces yellow, black, or red nodules that stick to the hairs.Odor was a symptom of trichomycosis in 35.7% of cases, according to the 2013 study.TrimethylaminuriaTrimethylaminuria is a rare condition. Increased levels of the compound trimethylamine  in the body cause trimethylaminuria. TMA has a fish-like smell. The body releases TMA through the urine, sweat, or breath.Bacteria in the gut produces TMA. According to the National Institutes of Health, a person with trimethylaminuria may have inherited a faulty gene that means the body cannot break down TMA properly.Treatment can include taking activated charcoal supplements to help remove excess TMA from the body. B12 supplements, antibiotics, and probiotics may also help.Meat consumptionDietary choices may affect body odor, including whether people eat meat or not.An older study from 2006 found that participants on a meat diet had body odor which others perceived as less attractive than the body odor of participants on a non-meat diet.Dairy consumptionIn rare cases, eating eggs and milk can cause a person’s sweat to smell different. This is because dairy products produce trimethylamine when the body digests them, which has a strong, fishy smell.A 2015 study found that trimethylamine-N-oxide  levels increased after the participants ate dairy products. Trimethylamine produces TMAO.Although trimethylamine-N-oxide is odorless, if a person cannot digest trimethylamine properly, the body may release it through sweat and cause body odor.Spices and seasoningsSpices such as cumin or curry can change a person’s sweat odor. This is because they can create sulfur-like compounds when digested, which can react with sweat and cause odor.Onions, herbs, and garlic can also have the same effect.StressA person may sweat due to stress. The International Hyperhidrosis Society states that the apocrine glands are responsible for producing stress-related sweat.Sweat from the apocrine glands is thicker and contains more proteins and lipids. When this type of sweat sits on the skin and mixes with bacteria, it can create a smell.HormonesA person’s hormones may change during puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause.Decreasing estrogen levels during menopause may cause sweating, which can increase odor if it mixes with bacteria on the skin.People can take several steps to prevent sweat smelling like ammonia. These include:Changing the dietTo prevent the body from using protein as energy after exercise, which may cause their sweat to smell like ammonia, a person can increase the amount of carbohydrates in their diet.Whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and beans are healthy sources of carbohydrates.Additionally, if a person notices that certain foods, such as fish or dairy, make their sweat smell like ammonia, they can reduce their intake of those foods or remove them from their diet.Drinking more waterIncreased water intake can dilute sweat and make its odor less noticeable.Deodorants and anti-perspirantsA person can use deodorants to cover up the ammonia smell from sweat.They can also try antiperspirants, which block the sweat glands and stop sweating from happening. This can reduce the amount of sweat on the skin that mixes with bacteria and produces odor.Changing clothesA person can try changing their clothes more frequently to keep their skin dry and free of bacteria that can react with sweat and cause odor.WashingAntibacterial soap can fight bacteria on the skin. This will keep the skin clean and fight any odor from bacteria mixing with sweat. Antifungal creams or powders can also help a person reduce their risk of fungal infections.Reducing stressIf a person notices they sweat more with stress, they can try evaluating the sources of stress in their life.If they are able to reduce their stress levels, they may sweat less and reduce any odors that were occurring because of their stress.A person whose sweat smells like ammonia should look out for symptoms of an underlying condition.If their urine has a strong ammonia smell, this may be a sign of diabetes. If a person notices blood in their urine, or that their urine is foamy, this may be a sign of kidney disease.Fungal infections may cause rashes, sores, or blisters. A person should contact a doctor if they think they may have a fungal skin infection.To help control body odor, the International Hyperhidrosis Society recommends:keeping the skin drywashing with antibacterial soapreducing sweating by using antiperspirantsmasking odors with deodorantsA person can also contact a doctor to discuss the following medical treatments:Microwave thermolysisMicrowave thermolysis is a treatment that uses microwave energy to stop the sweat glands from working properly.A 2013 study found that microwave thermolysis was an effective treatment for sweat that produced odors.BotoxThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration  has approved the use of onabotulinumtoxinA, or Botox, to treat excessive sweating.Botox can be an effective treatment for hyperhidrosis as it blocks the chemical that signals for the sweat glands to produce sweat.According to the International Hyperhidrosis Society, Botox can cause an 82-87% reduction in underarm sweating. Botox injections can be effective in stopping underarm sweating for 4-12 months, and possibly up to 14 months.Prescription antiperspirantsThe International Hyperhidrosis Society recommends antiperspirants to help control excessive sweating and body odor.Prescription antiperspirants may contain higher amounts of active ingredients than over-the-counter antiperspirants. These active ingredients can include metallic salts such as aluminum chloride hexahydrate.Prescription antiperspirants are most effective when people apply them both at night and in the morning.AntibioticsA person can use antibiotics to treat underlying conditions that cause sweat to smell like ammonia, such as trichomycosis.Many things can influence the smell of a person’s sweat. Diet, exercise, and bacterial infections may all alter body odor.A person living with a health condition such as diabetes or kidney disease may also have sweat that smells like ammonia.A person can try antiperspirants to reduce the amount they sweat, and deodorants to cover up any odors. A doctor can treat any underlying health conditions to help reduce the ammonia smell in sweat."

Your body is full of signals that are trying to tell you something—whether you’re training too hard, not eating enough, needing more sleep. The problem is you don’t always recognize the signals your body is giving you. These signals don’t come in words; they come in the form of organic molecules and complex interplays between them. Some of those interplays give off odd sensations and experiences when things go askew in training, and it’s those sensations that you should listen to.  RELATED: Why Do I Shiver After a Race?Here are some common body signals you should pay attention to:1. Ammonia SmellSmelling ammonia usually happens towards the end of a long or challenging workout and is a strong indicator that you have been burning protein as fuel. The reason you smell ammonia is because the protein breakdown product urea is being produced faster than it can be excreted by your kidneys, and is subsequently leached into your sweat as ammonia.  What your body is telling you is your muscles are being directly broken down, metabolized, and used for energy during your exercise. Not ideal! The way to prevent this is to fuel with a higher carbohydrate intake before and during exercise.RELATED: The 10 Best Carbohydrate Sources for Athletes2. Metallic Taste“Tasting the penny” is a badge of honor for old-school track and cross country folks, but it probably just means you are rupturing blood cells because of your extremely high-intensity effort. Running an all-out 400m or doing a hard 90-second anaerobic effort on a bike might get you there, because of the high intensity. While probably not harmful overall, what you are really tasting is the contents of your damaged blood cells—so definitely not something to strive for.  3. Craving Solid Food in TrainingIf you are hungry in training, you are way behind in your intra-workout fueling and, as far as your performance is concerned, it’s an emergency. Here’s why:Imagine being in a haunted house and getting scared so much you jumped and your skin tingled. I doubt your next thought was, “I’m hungry.” Hunger was the last thing on your mind, because the body has advanced cellular and hormone signaling that is designed to strongly inhibit hunger during times of fight or flight. The strongest of those hormones is epinephrine.Epinephrine is also released during exercise, because it’s responsible for many of the cellular cascades that result in energy availability.If you sense hunger during prolonged exercise, it means your hunger signals are so overwhelmingly strong that they have overpowered the extraordinarily strong hunger-inhibiting effect of epinephrine. This only happens when you are lightyears behind on intra-workout fueling.  Craving solid food is such a common report among endurance folks, we wrote a quantitative guide to help athletes fuel their training and racing more appropriately.4. Weakness, Faintness, Irritability, Profuse or Unusual SweatingThese are signs of hypoglycemia. You know that time your niece or nephew ate cake and ice cream, was energetic for 45 minutes, but then started screaming and sobbing because they dropped their crayon and you didn’t pick it up fast enough? That was hypoglycemia. It’s the same sugar crash parents try to avoid in their children. The most common times we experience this as adults is soon after the onset of exercise, if we mistimed our prior meal or delayed our intra-workout nutrition.How to avoid hypoglycemia: Do not eat in the 30 to 75 minutes pre-exercise. Limit yourself to high-glycemic index foods in the 20-minute window pre-exercise, or stick to a healthy balanced meal when eating 2 to 2.5 hours pre-exercise. Start your intra-workout fueling strategy at the onset of training.5. Insatiable Thirst, No Matter How Much You DrinkYou may be perfectly well-hydrated if this is something you feel. Chances are you are a health-conscious person who generally chooses low-sodium foods and drinks plenty of water. Turns out, if you are thirsty during exercise and you have been drinking plenty, you probably need more sodium, not water! Hyponatremia has grave clinical consequences when severe, but when mild it makes you thirstier than your hydration status should lead you to be. High-electrolyte beverages or adding table salt to your carbohydrate beverage will help.RELATED: Are You Doing Thirst Right? The Science Says Probably Not6. Queasiness or Urge to VomitUsually the urge to vomit, in the absence of gut cramping or pain, is the result of acid dumping into your stomach from very high-intensity activity. Think: a sprint finish. This effort causes rapid acid production in muscle and it gets shuttled into your stomach as your body tries to get rid of it.7. Painful or Cramping StomachStomach pain and upper gut cramping is usually the result of over-concentration or excess energy density of stomach contents. It might seem like not too big of a deal to take a couple gels since they’re so low-volume, but that concentration of carbohydrate and pure molecular concentration in the solution of your stomach is the perfect recipe for cramping and some severe stomach pain. The key is to drink water with your gels, especially if on an empty stomach.RELATED: Ask Stacy: How Can I Prevent GI Distress While Running?8. Upset Lower IntestinesBest way to upset your lower GI tract in a hurry during a race or training? Consume a hyperosmolar solution and do not chase it with water. Usually this is the result of consuming too many gels with too little fluid or something more than 2000mg sodium per liter of water. Keep the carb solutions between 60-140g carbs per liter, and the sodium between 300-1500mg per liter and you should avoid this, no problem. 9. Sweet Taste- or Flavor-AvoidanceA common report among those of us who go long in training: “X product is too sweet for me.” And you are probably right. Many products simply overdo the flavor because they are not designed for more than three hours of exercise, let alone long-distance triathlons. If you’re not consuming one of these high-flavor or super-sweet beverages, and you’re still finding that you just want something savory, rather than sweet, you’re probably way behind on your sodium consumption needs, and would benefit from increasing your current sodium consumption rates to 1000-1500 mg per liter.When your body talks and gives you signals, listen to it—even if it takes some paying attention to figure out what it’s trying to say.Dr. Alex Harrison, a certified USA Triathlon coach, holds a PhD in Sport Physiology and Performance.
